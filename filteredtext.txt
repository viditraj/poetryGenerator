Kuru Women visit Battle-field Spake ancient Dhrita-rashtra, father hundred sons, Sonless sorrow-stricken, dark ebbing life-tide runs! 'Gods fulfil life's last wishes! Henchmen, yoke royal car, Dhrita-rashtra meets princes silent field war, Speed unto Queen Gandhari, dames Kuru's house, dear departed warrior wends fair faithful spouse!' Queen Gandhari sorrow-laden ancient Pritha came, weeping widowed princess wailing childless dame, saw hoary monarch, father perished race, Fresh loud awoke sorrow, welling tears suffused face, Good Vidura ever gentle whispered comfort unto all, Placed dames within chariots, left Hastina's palace hall! Loud wail woe sorrow rose every Kuru house, Children wept beside mothers widowed royal spouse, Veiled dwellers palace, scarce gods face seen, Heedless mart city sped widowed childless queen, royal brow bosom gem jewel cast aside, Loose robes loose tresses, quenched haughty queenly pride! falls antlered monarch, struck woe sudden fear Issuing snowy mountains listless stray dappled deer, upon broad arena milk-white fillies brave sun, Wildly toss flowing tresses sad disorder run! Clinging weeping sister wept dame cureless pain, lord, son father deathful battle slain, Wept smote throbbing bosom bitter anguish wailed, Till senses reeled sorrow, till woman's reason failed! Veiled queens bashful maidens, erst shunned public eye, Blush shame suffused faces passed city by, Gentle-bosomed, kindly hearted, erst wiped other's eye, common sorrow laden none sister heaved sigh! troop wailing women, deep woe, disconsolate, Slow monarch Kurus passed Hastina's outer gate, Men stall loom anvil, men every guild trade, Left city monarch, open country strayed, universal sorrow filled air answering sky, ends mortal's _Yuga_ end world nigh! II Gandhari's Lament Slain Stainless Queen stainless woman, ever righteous ever good, Stately mighty sorrow field Gandhari stood! Strewn skulls clotted tresses, darkened stream gore, limbs countless warriors red field covered o'er, Elephants steeds battle, car-borne chiefs untimely slain, Headless trunks heads dissevered fill red ghastly plain! long-drawn howl jackals o'er scene carnage rings, vulture raven flap dark loathsome wings, Feasting blood warriors foul _pisachas_ fill air, Viewless forms hungry _rakshas_ limb limb corpses tear! scene death carnage ancient monarch led, Kuru dames faltering footsteps stepped amidst countless dead, piercing wail anguish burst upon echoing plain, saw sons fathers, brothers, lords, amidst slain, saw wolves jungle feed upon destined prey, Darksome wanderers midnight prowling light day! Shriek pain wail anguish o'er ghastly field resound, feeble footsteps falter sink upon ground, Sense life desert mourners faint common grief, Death-like swoon succeeding sorrow yields moment's short relief! mighty sigh anguish Gandhari's bosom broke, Gazing anguished daughters unto Krishna thus spoke: 'Mark unconsoled daughters, widowed queens Kuru's house, Wailing dear departed, like osprey spouse! cold fading feature wakes woman's love, amidst lifeless warriors still restless steps rove, Mothers hug slaughtered children unconscious sleep, Widows bend upon husbands ceaseless sorrow weep! Mighty Bhishma, hath fallen? quenched archer Karna's pride? Drupad monarch Panchala sleeps foeman Drona's side? Shining mail costly jewels, royal bangles strew plain, Golden garlands rich burnished deck chiefs untimely slain, Lances hurled stalwart fighters, clubs mighty wrestlers killed, Swords bows ample measure, quivers still arrows filled! Mark unforgotten heroes, jungle prowlers 'mid stray, brow mailed bosoms heedless perch birds prey! Mark great unconquered heroes famed earth west east, _Kankas_ perch upon foreheads, hungry wolves upon feast! Mark kings, softest cushion scarce needed rest found, lie peaceful slumber hard reddened ground! Mark youths morn evening listed minstrel's song, ear loathsome jackal doth doleful wail prolong! See chieftains maces swords trusty steel, Still grasp tried weapons,--do still life-pulse feel?'

''Mother!' said dear Duryodhan went unto war, 'Wish joy wish triumph mount battle-car!' 'Son!' said dear Duryodhan, 'Heaven avert cruel fate, _Yato dharma stato jayah!_ Triumph doth Virtue wait!' set heart battle, valour wiped sins, dwells realms celestial faithful warrior wins! weep Duryodhan, like prince fought fell, sorrow-stricken husband, misfortunes tell? Ay! son brave princely, resistless war, sleeps sleep warriors, sunk gloom glorious star! Ay! son mid crowned monarchs held first foremost way, rests upon red earth, quenched bright effulgent ray! Ay! son best heroes, hath warrior's sky, Kshatras nobly conquer, Krishna, war nobly die! Hark loathsome cry jackals, wolves vigils keep, Maidens rich song beauty erst wont watch sleep! Hark foul blood-beaked vultures flap wings upon dead, Maidens waved feathery _pankhas_ round Duryodhan's royal bed! Peerless bowman, mighty monarch! nations still hests obeyed, lion slays tiger, Bhima hath Duryodhan slayed! Thirteen years o'er Kuru's empire proud Duryodhan held sway, Ruled Hastina's ancient city fair Ganga's waters stray! seen regal splendour ancient eyes mine, Elephants battle-chariots, steeds war herds kine! Kuru owns another master Duryodhan's day fled, live witness! Krishna, dead! Mark Duryodhan's noble widow, mother proud Lakshman bold, Queenly youth beauty, like altar bright gold! Torn husband's sweet embraces, son's entwining arms, Doomed life-long woe anguish youth charms! Rend hard stony bosom crushed beneath cruel pain, Gandhari live witness noble son grandson slain? Mark Duryodhan's widow, hugs gory head, gentle hands tender softly holds bed! dear departed husband turns dearer son, tear-drops mother choke widow's bitter groan! Like fibre lotus tender-golden frame, lotus! daughter! Bharat's pride Kuru's fame! truth resides _Vedas_, brave Duryodhan dwells above, Wherefore linger sadness severed cherished love? truth resides _Sastra_, dwells sky hero son, Gandhari daughter earthly task done!' IV Funeral Rite Victor deathful battle, sad Yudhishthir viewed plain, Friends kinsmen, kings chieftains, countless troops untimely slain, spake wise Sudharman, pious priest Kuru's race, Unto Sanjay, unto Dhaumya, Vidura full grace, Spake unto brave Yuyutsu, Kuru's last surviving chief, Spake faithful Indrasena, warriors sunk grief: 'Pious rites due foemen friends kinsmen slain, None shall lack fitting funeral, none shall perish plain.' Wise Vidura comrades sped sacred duty bound, Sandalwood scented aloes, oil _ghee_ perfumes found, Silken robes costly splendour, fabrics artist wove, Dry wood thorny jungle, perfume scented grove, Shattered cars splintered lances, hewed ready fire, Piled ranged perfect order many funeral pyre.

Smokeless radiant lustre shone red lighted pyre, Like planets bright sky throbbing celestial fire! Countless myriads, nameless, friendless, court camp afar, east west collected, fell Kuru-Kshetra's war, Thousand fires lighted, received pious rite, good Yudhishthir's mandate, wise Vidura's might, dead burned ashes sacred rite o'er, Dhrita-rashtra Yudhishthir slowly walked Ganga's shore! V Oblation Karna Sacred Ganga, ample-bosomed, sweeps along regal pride, Rolling limpid waters high banks either side, Kuru dames weeping widows thither anguish came Due holy rites render departed chiefs fame, Casting forth jewelled girdles, gems scarfs belaced gold, Gave oblations water hero true bold, Unto fathers, unto husbands, unto sons battle slayed, Offerings sacred water sorrowing wives mothers made. great host mourners wending perform rite, footsteps made pathway sad sacred site, shelving banks Ganga peopled sorrowing train, Wide-expanding, vast sealike, formed scene woe pain! wave keener sorrow swept o'er Pritha's heaving breast, unto weeping children thus secret expressed: _'He, sons, peerless bowman, mighty battle-car, bore stamp hero, slain Arjun war,_ _He son Radha, chariot-driver, ye thought, shone SURYA'S lustre countless foes fought,_ _He faced stoutest warriors battle never failed, led Kuru forces danger never quailed,_ _He knew peer prowess, owned war haughtier name, yielded life, honour, death hath conquered fame,_ _He, truth never faltered, never left vow undone, Offer unto oblation, Karna eldest son!_ _Karna honoured elder, Sun inspired birth, Karna rings armour Sun-like trod spacious earth!'_ Pritha spake, terror-stricken Pandav brothers groaned pain, wept woe anguish brother slain. Hissing forth sigh sorrow like trodden, hissing snake, Sad Yudhishthir mother thus inward feelings spake: 'Didst thou, mother, bear hero fathomless like ocean dread, Whose unfailing glistening arrows like countless billows sped? Didst thou bear peerless archer, all-resistless car, Sweeping roar ocean shattered ranks war? Didst thou bear mighty hero, mortal man heavenly birth, Crushing 'neath arm valour foemen earth?

Curious sad, upon fresh-dug hill, village lads stood melancholy still; idle children, wandering fro, nature guided, took tone woe. Arrived home, gazed around, every place found: seat table wont fill; fireside chair, still set, vacant still; garden-walks, labour own; latticed bower, trailing shrubs o'ergrown; Sunday pew fill'd race, place sacred place: That, call'd sorrows eyes, Pierced full heart, forced still rise. Ye sigh sun, course fulfilled, glorious course, rejoicing earth sky, soft evening, winds stilled, Sinks islands departure spread O'er warm-colored heaven ruddy mountain head. weep ye him, who, bound man's appointed years, last.

I. Thus long grief kept dumb: Sure there's lethargy mighty woe, Tears stand congealed, cannot flow; sad soul retires inmost room: Tears, stroke foreseen, afford relief; But, unprovided sudden blow, Like Niobe, marble grow, petrify grief. British heaven serene, threatening cloud nigh, least wrinkle deform sky; lived unconcerned happily first age nature's golden scene; Supine amidst flowing store, slept securely, dreamt more; suddenly thunder-clap heard, took us, unprepared, guard, Already lost feared. amazing news Charles spread, general voice declared, “Our gracious prince dead.” sickness known before, slow disease, soften grief degrees; But, like hurricane Indian seas, tempest rose; unexpected burst woes. scarce breathing space betwixt, becalmed, perishing next. great Atlas height sink beneath heavenly weight, And, mighty flaw, flaming wall, shall, gape immense, and, rushing down, o'erwhelm nether ball; swift surprising fear: Atlas fell indeed; Hercules near. II. pious brother, sure best ever bore name, newly risen rest, And, fervent flame, usual morning vows addressed, dear sovereign's health; hoped heard, long increase years, honour, fame, wealth: Guiltless greatness, thus always prayed, knew wished vows made, head repaid. Soon ill-omen'd rumour reached ear, (Ill news winged fate, flies apace), describe amazement face! Horror pomp there, Mute magnificent, without tear; hero first seen fear. Half unarrayed ran relief, hasty artless grief: Approaching greatness met charms power future state; looked ghastly brother's fate, shook arms. Arrived within mournful room, saw wild distraction, void awe, arbitrary grief unbounded law. God's image, God's anointed, lay Without motion, pulse, breath, senseless lump sacred clay, image death, Amidst sad attendants' groans cries, lines adored forgiving face, Distorted native grace; iron slumber sat majestic eyes. pious duke—Forbear, audacious muse! terms thy feeble art use able adorn vast woe: grief rest like subject-grief show His, like sovereign's, transcend; wife, brother, grief could know, name friend.

Thus, alternate course, tyrant passions, hope fear, extremes appear, flashed upon soul equal force. Thus, half ebb, rolling sea Returns, wins upon shore; watery herd, affrighted roar, Rest fins awhile, stay, backward take wondering way: prophet wonders they, prodigies rarely seen before, cries,—“A king must fall, kingdoms change sway.” counter-tides land, Presaging fatal blow, prodigious ebb flow. royal soul, that, like labouring moon, charms art hurried down, Forced regret leave native sphere, Came liking here, Soon weary painful strife, made faint essays life: evening light Soon shut night; strong distemper, weak relief, Short intervals joy, long returns grief.

XIII. new-born phœnix takes way, rich paternal regions survey, airy choristers numerous train Attend wondrous progress o'er plain; So, rising father's urn, glorious Charles return; officious muses came along, gay harmonious quire, like angels ever young; muse, mourns now, happy triumph sung. Even could thrive auspicious reign; plenteous crop bore purest well-winnowed grain, Britain never knew before. Though little hire, light gain, Yet somewhat share threw; Fed hand, sung flew, Like birds paradise, lived morning dew. Oh never let lays name forget! pension prince's praise great. Live then, thou great encourager arts, Live ever thankful hearts; Live blest above, almost invoked below; Live receive pious vow, patron once, guardian angel now! Thou Fabius sinking state, didst wise delays divert fate, faction like tempest rose, death's hideous form, art rage thou didst oppose, weather storm; quitting thy supreme command, Thou heldst rudder steady hand, Till safely shore bark land; bark, blessings brought, Charged thyself James, doubly-royal fraught. XIV. Oh frail estate human things, slippery hopes below! cost emptiness know; 'tis lesson dearly bought, Assurance never sought. best, best beloved kings, best deserving so, scarce escaped fatal blow faction conspiracy, Death promised hopes destroy; toiled, gained, lived enjoy. mists Providence cannot see! saints, supernatural power set free, left last martyrdom die; end oft-repeated miracles.— Forgive me, heaven, impious thought, 'Twas grief Charles, madness wrought, questioned thy supreme decree! Thou didst gracious reign prolong, Even thy saints' angels' wrong, fellow-citizens immortality: twelve long years exile borne, Twice twelve numbered since blest return: strictly wert thou pay, Even driblet day. Yet still murmur, complain quails manna longer rain: miracles 'twas needless renew; chosen flock promised land view. XV. warlike prince ascends regal state, prince long exercised fate: Long may keep, though obtains late! Heroes heaven's peculiar mould cast; They, poets, formed haste; Man first God's design, man made last. False heroes, made flattery so, Heaven strike out, like sparkles, blow; ere prince perfection brought, costs Omnipotence second thought. toil sweat, hardening cold, forming heat, Cyclops strokes repeat, impenetrable shield wrought. looks Maker would noble work his, 'twas tried found master-piece. XVI. View monarch ripened throne. Alcides thus race began, O'er infancy swiftly ran; future god first man: Dangers toils, Juno's hate, Even o'er cradle lay wait, grappled first fate; young hands hissing snakes prest, early Deity confest; Thus, degrees, rose Jove's imperial seat; Thus difficulties prove soul legitimately great. Like his, hero's infancy tried; Betimes furies snakes provide, infant arms oppose father's rebels, brother's foes; opprest, higher still rose. preludes fate, formed manhood, subdue hydra many-headed hissing crew. XVII. Numa's peaceful reign, martial Ancus sceptre wield, Furbished rusty sword again, Resumed long-forgotten shield, led Latins dusty field; James drowsy genius wakes Britain long entranced charms, Restiff slumbering arms; 'Tis roused, and, new-strung nerve, spear already shakes. neighing warrior steeds, drum, louder trumpet, needs inspire coward, warm cold; voice, sole appearance, makes bold. Gaul Batavia dread impending blow; well vigour arm know; lick dust, crouch beneath fatal foe. Long may fear awful prince, provoke lingering sword; Peace sure defence, best security word. changes doubtful state, truth, like heaven's, kept inviolate; promise make fate. valour triumph o'er land main; broken oaths fame stain; conquest basely bought, inglorious gain. XVIII. once, heaven, unfold thy adamantine book; let wondering senate see, thy firm immutable decree, least second page strong contingency, consists wills, originally free. Let glad amazement look happiness may be; Let still obstinately blind, Still divert good thou hast designed, Or, malignant penury, starve royal virtues mind. Faith Christian's subject's test; Oh give believe, surely blest. do; distant view see amended vows English loyalty; beyond object, appears long retinue prosperous reign, series successful years, orderly array, martial, manly train. Behold e'en remoter shores, conquering navy proudly spread; British cannon formidably roars, While, starting oozy bed, asserted Ocean rears reverend head, view recognise ancient lord again; willing hand, restores fasces main. Рояль, будильник, телефон Заткнутся к черту. Псу сахарную косточку кидай. Гробовщиков, продавших гроб, Хвали и одари рублем. Аэроплан на небе Пусть разгонит облака. И струи выхлопного газа Чертят МЕРТВ ОН. На шеях голубей плакаты Пусть сообщают новость ВСЕМ. Дорожный полисмен, Следящий за порядком на шоссе, Оденет черные перчатки. Он был как компас. Мне показывал На север, юг, На запад, на восток. Руководил в рабочие часы, И управлял прогулкой По субботам. Я думал это вечно Будет продолжаться. Теперь ни звезд, ни лун, Ни света солнца не хочу. Теперь осталось Океану высыхать. И некому в лесу Кострище шуровать. Теперь добра не сыщешь. W.H. Auden Funeral Blues 1 Stop clocks, cut telephone, Prevent dog barking juicy bone, Silence pianos muffled drum Bring coffin, let mourners come. Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling sky message Dead, Put crepe bows round white necks public doves, Let traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. North, South, East West, working week Sunday rest, noon, midnight, talk, song; thought love would last ever: wrong. stars wanted now: put every one; Pack moon dismantle sun; Pour away ocean sweep wood. nothing ever come good. 18th November 1852 “VICTORY!” cry must be.
