Look at the frog so small and cute
top to tail in his green suite
never dry not always wet
every child wants one for a pet
only the newt for a friend
swim in the pond from end to end
deep under water breath held tight
look at him swim such a delight
hear him call all through the night
a prince in waiting a king by right
leaping high jumping long
for his size he is so strong
from lilly pads he loves to hop
as he hits the water plip plip plop
see him catch the fly swallow swallow
with a blink of his eyes gobble gobble
look at the frog so small and cute
top to tail in his green suite
Sun of an obnoxious quarry as we seem
To be laughing—
Open throated frog princes all of the way
Up to the chandeliers—
While my mother waits in some awful
Mockery of a Pieta—
And the lamps bloom in the gold dusts of
The mines—
Another song mimics the song bird's,
As the traffic becomes utterly confused—
Losing itself into the darkness—
The mailman apexes, but he is no excuse
To me—
Lamp posts lining the streets of my adolescents,
As wicked men travel home after
The fireworks' pageantry—
Licking their stolen wives' bodies of
An adulterous
Apiary.
A small and green but drunken frog
sat in the evening on his log.
He contemplated there on life
and wished he had a green frog wife.
He'd interviewd a thousand frogs,
kept diaries and detailed logs.
But never did he find the one
who'd rest all day out in the sun
and dream with him at night in bed
so this green frog was never wed.
One day he saw, down near the trees
a British subject. What a tease!
She was a trifle big but, well,
we cannot all live in a shell.
She chatted with the folks and then
there was a silence among men.
They looked at her, so did the frog
he sat, quite drunken, on his log.
He dreamed that if he ever were...
this was the girl. If frogs could purr! ! !
Frogs are green
like chlorophyll
their eyes bulge out at you
they can be mean
and further still
can  fit inside a shoe.
They have a land
all to their own
it ain't a small one, no
so shake their hand
'cause they are prone
to see you as a foe.
They eat their legs
and also snails
and drink the Beaujolais
a frog who begs
is one who fails
be warned, that's all I say.
A stereotype
is something which
applies to definition
of all the hype
it's really Kitsch
and now I'm going fishing.
A frog
Is gifted with
A loud baritone
But it's noise prone!
A nightingale
Is gifted with a sweet tone
Which is a pleasant one!

Away from old pond
leaps olympic longjump frog
squelching sounds beyond.
Frog resting on a
Lily pad in quiet pond—
Floating right along.
The frog- on the arm
Of the balance! How to weigh-
Please tell me the way.
Dated: 17th July 2019.
Moonlit night and
A moonlit pond, a frog riddled
with emotions
the frog and I
exchange glances
both motionless
three flies circling
the frog
two flies circling
Hopping frog, hop here and be seen,
I'll not pelt you with stick or stone:
Your cap is laced and your coat is green;
Good bye, we'll let each other alone.
Plodding toad, plod here and be looked at,
You the finger of scorn is crooked at:
But though you're lumpish, you're harmless too;
You won't hurt me, and I won't hurt you.
I fell in love with a frog,
who was sitting alone on the banks of the Nile,
mooning over the premature decease of his beautiful wife.
He was sobbing his heart out,
his lips convulsed with woe, dripping emotion,
his chin atremble, the words buried in a raven black but deafening silence.
I instantly knew he was the find of my ultimate search for love.
A bathos unknown to those seeking earthly pleasures,
a poignancy knocking vulgarity off its temporal pedestal.
My dear love, dearest of all other loves,
my love for this frog, please become a wreath
a halo, a redemptive power to soothe all pain
Frog,
I hate you.
You don't deserve to live
You have an ugly face
You're not the prince
Even you have your first kiss
Frog,
I really really hate you.
You're just a food for a hungry snake,
So, stay away from me before I give you a kick!
joining me
in a bath
bathroom frog
as i bathe
the frog experiences
a storm
(john tiong chunghoo)
inspired by
for me all alone
his sober face...
a frog

An island frog, the humans say
How does such a residence be?
Salt water eats frog skin away.
No frog opts to go by sea.
The frog does call the island home,
And has done so millions of years.
Surrounding seas - no need to roam.
And of the first frog pioneers?
How did they make the trip across
The salty ocean to the isle?
Inquiring minds are at a loss
About this frog's island lifestyle.
Only the humans seem to care.
The frog just knows the frog is there.
On his throne log
in kingdom bog
shrouded by fog
croaks the frog
Frog in well defined as knowledge confined,
Come out of it with knowledge refined,
May be areas used so compact and defined,
Inherent possession is must …………………
Knowledge or power to spread over horizon
Frequent debates, contacts taking place in zone
In depth study and answer with solid reasons,
Surely to find result as that of seasons,
When Sun rays emerge and shine in sky,
Darkness disappears and still no one ask why?
Spread of knowledge end misery and plight,
Go ahead and cruise with direction and flight,
We may remain aloof and total in disarray,
Supremacy to gain with permanent sway,
Never yield to blackmail and not to give away,
Should make it with easy access and way?
Can Sun be blanketed or hidden with shade?
Will swords be useless in front of spade?
Knowledge is like power so will emerge and surface,
May be more accurate as heat from furnace,
Deep buried inside with innumerable secrets,
Inside vision may understand and interpret,
Efforts may be needed to understand it more,
Secrets may be unveiled and result come to fore,
Nature never confines or secrets hide,
You may need vision with angle wide,
Always do part with but not with any side,
Water waves move on with calm or tide,
Why mountain volcano erupts and cause land to slide?
Suggest more open ways to think and decide,
Power is force which can't be retained,
Prisoner to be released if wrongly detained,
Knowledge is power and has to be realized,
Widespread of area has to be materialized,
To die with the secrets does not serve purpose,
Even kings abdicate when fear sudden depose
I am called a leaf frog - guess why!
Yep - cuz I blend in like a leaf,
Waiting for a snack to come by,
To my delight, to the snack's grief.
An insect is such snack I seek,
And when it does roam close enough,
I give it my flicked tongue technique,
Stick on the snack and down I stuff
It to my tummy to digest.
I cannot chew, so blink my eyes
So that my eyeballs are so pressed
To help push down my insect prize.
So why so happy do I be?
Becuz I do eat what bugs me.
Goodness gracious could it be true
Prince Charming, is it really you
She leaps up, over frogs forever
Into the arms of happily ever after
Man prides himself with intelligence
Human Logic rationalizing,
But what he really lacks is Patience
When the moment requires some waiting.
Today a frog in blithe expertise,
Had some short lessons laid in action.
He showed that trying should never cease,
For Success comes with Repetition.
He jumped on a green stalk, missing twice.
Then returned to make good his attempt.
Jumped once more, no defeat in his eyes -
He missed, but held the end of the hemp.
He climbed one leg up, still holding on,
His frog face tinged the trace of a smile,
His other arm grasped at victory won -
Sat on top of the leaf in a while!
When speaking
this orator sounds
like a frog
This frog was partying and left rather late
In the darkness his home he could not locate
Spotted a bat flying in the air
His dilemma he made aware
My pleasure I’ll fly you home to your mate
This snake was eyeing a frog for his lunch
They struck at each other with a crunch
It was a stand off
A solution was far off
For both of them was unable to munch
Evening shower pours down heavily
Rain water falls like a torrent, overflowing everywhere.
The automatic night light just turned on outside my house.
I stand inside the house, watching the western sky.
Two cats lean on their stretched front legs.
Their noses touch the house screen door.
Their lungs are filled with inhaled rain mists.
Suddenly, there arise loud croaks from a nearby Koi pond.
Stimulated by heavy rain, this frog longs for a companion.
He waited a long time without a croaking response.
So sad a night for this frog who will spend his night alone.
Rain shower falls, and falls without a pause.
Who knows the sadness of a frog longing for a mate at my Koi pond?

A tiny Costa Rica frog
was caught in heavy rains
He hops around to get away
Pitter patter water pains
He chanced upon a tender leaf
that stood on single stalk
enough to shade the little frog.
he waits for water stop
And when it did the little frog
Jumps off the saviour stalk
he croaks aloud and naturally
escapes in grateful hop
Mary had a little frog
And it was water-soaked,
But Mary did not keep it long
Because, of course, it croaked!
He was meditating on a lotus,
Eyes half closed breathing slowly.
Dawn was falling through a sieve,
as silver grainy mist from heaven.
Moon takes a last dip in the pond,
wading through the dark waters.
He walks away to eastern horizon,
wearing his wet cloths still dripping.
Eyes closed water lilies looks aloof.
Pre-dawn mysteries yet to arrive,
flakes of moon light still afloat,
as Beauty of daybreak had to unfold soon.
Slowly sun signalled the curtain raiser.
Golden brooms swept darkness away.
Symphony of life started performing.
Opera house reverberated with music of life.
He woke up suddenly from his trance.
His throat moved in folds of waves.
Lotuses started to open eyes one by one.
There he leaped, splashed his tongue, came out,
With a dragon fly struggling in his mouth.
Again went into depth of silent contemplation!
Tongue tied! Camouflaged!
++++++++++++++++
If a common noun is made adjective
And noun is faithful and very active
Faithful friend since time immemorial,
Loved by us yet his loyalty is a slang
If a common noun is made adjective
Who is furious formidable n reactive,
If we give the tag name, we are happy,
Not faithful, not loyal, blood rocky
We love the cruelty and this is fact,
What we want and what's the act,
"Dog of God and not God of Dog"
Our thought is wrapped with fog
Ah! We are the holy born, the rogue,
On faith's well a noisy -noisy  frog
I am
A piece of paper, creased with folds;
The jumping brother of all the tadpoles.
Move me around or croak a song
I'll be sure to sing along!
Even though I don't have a voice,
But you're a child, so imagine the noise.
But not the poison, the green's just ink!
My limbs just proof I did not sink!
Unlike my brothers, oh so many of them
Bound to the scavenger earth with their black stem.
They couldn't manage to change from being change;
Metal's a terrible material to make tadpoles, anyway.
Phileas the frog was awfully large -
To see the muscle in his thighs -
A sight bedazzling to your eyes!
With plenty there to feed a town -
If you would dare to take him down!
Phileas the frog could tow a barge.
One hefty bound could clear a tree -
A scary sight I'll guarantee!
And something else to make me dread:
Were he to land upon my head!
Phileas the frog was known as 'Sarge -'
Accounted by that massive chest.
No other frog would care to jest
That tidy Phileas!
So if you've sense and know your place -
And hold some value to your face,
Then don't get supercilious
With Phileas!

The frog proclaims unabashedly
Within hearing of everyone
He brags that he has paid his dues
And did it even before the last hour,
Paid much more than what was worth
Every bit of what was owed and more
So, he held his head up high
Nothing else matters now
The day is a mockery for him,
Beneath an imagined sun,
Basking in delight in a shrouded glow
Owning the dark of night,
The cold of the puddle,
An empty inheritance in creased parchment,
He now croaks his incessant boast
In a pond where day refuses to come
When the rain pattered
The frog started croaking
The monkey on the tree warned
'Danger is in ambush'
She wouldn't listen too
'I know, my father
Keeps saying this'
She said
The monkey didn't ask
'Is your father too a monkey? '
The frog got finished
In one hiss
So was she finished
In one miss
The croaking toad and the leopard frog,
Were drinking beer on a hollow log.
And the croaking toad said, you're my best bud,
Man you can really hold your suds.
And the leopard frog replied in kind,
Another friend like you, I couldn't find.
You're my best friend when skies are grey,
You're by my side come what may.
I'd rather drink my beer with you,
Than catch blue bottles the whole day through.
Let's drink one more to the breaking dawn,
While we listen quietly to the crickets song.
But the croaking toad said I must go,
I'm very sleepy and the cock just crowed.
I'll see you tonight for a cold one or two,
I really love this black swamp brew.
And the leopard frog said I'll be here,
With my styrofoam ice chest sitting near.
Just bring some peanuts when you come round,
With beer they taste so good going down.

The Dog, the Frog, and the Hog
All met while jogging in fog.
‘Twas quite coincidental,
Simply accidental:
That serendipitous meet
In pea soup, trainers on feet.
Still, now they are friends
And all rather fit;
Those comrades in shorts
And wonderfully knit!

She let her golden ball fall down the well
And begged a cold frog to retrieve it;
For which she kissed his ugly, gaping mouth -
Indeed, he could scarce believe it.
And seeing him transformed to his princely shape,
Who had been by hags enchanted,
She knew she could never love another man
Nor by any fate be daunted.
But what would her royal father and mother say?
They had promised her in marriage
To a cousin whose wide kingdom marched with theirs,
Who rode in a jeweled carriage.
'Our plight, dear heart, would appear past human hope
To all except you and me: to all
Who have never swum as a frog in a dark well
Or have lost a golden ball.'
'What then shall we do now?' she asked her lover.
He kissed her again, and said:
'Is magic of love less powerful at your Court
Than at this green well-head?'
Once upon a time a frog
Croaked away in Bingle Bog
Every night from dusk to dawn
He croaked awn and awn and awn
Other creatures loathed his voice,
But, alas, they had no choice,
And the crass cacophony
Blared out from the sumac tree
At whose foot the frog each night
Minstrelled on till morning night
Neither stones nor prayers nor sticks.
Insults or complaints or bricks
Stilled the frogs determination
To display his heart's elation.
But one night a nightingale
In the moonlight cold and pale
Perched upon the sumac tree
Casting forth her melody
Dumbstruck sat the gaping frog
And the whole admiring bog
Stared towards the sumac, rapt,
And, when she had ended, clapped,
Ducks had swum and herons waded
To her as she serenaded
And a solitary loon
Wept, beneath the summer moon.
Toads and teals and tiddlers, captured
By her voice, cheered on, enraptured:
"Bravo! " "Too divine! " "Encore! "
So the nightingale once more,
Quite unused to such applause,
Sang till dawn without a pause.
Next night when the Nightingale
Shook her head and twitched her tail,
Closed an eye and fluffed a wing
And had cleared her throat to sing
She was startled by a croak.
"Sorry - was that you who spoke? "
She enquired when the frog
Hopped towards her from the bog.
"Yes," the frog replied. "You see,
I'm the frog who owns this tree
In this bog I've long been known
For my splendid baritone
And, of course, I wield my pen
For Bog Trumpet now and then"
"Did you… did you like my song? "
"Not too bad - but far too long.
The technique was fine of course,
But it lacked a certain force".
"Oh! " the nightingale confessed.
Greatly flattered and impressed
That a critic of such note
Had discussed her art and throat:
"I don't think the song's divine.
But - oh, well - at least it's mine".
"That's not much to boast about".
Said the heartless frog. "Without
Proper training such as I
- And few others can supply.
You'll remain a mere beginner.
But with me you'll be a winner"
"Dearest frog", the nightingale
Breathed: "This is a fairy tale -
And you are Mozart in disguise
Come to earth before my eyes".
"Well I charge a modest fee."
"Oh! " "But it won't hurt, you'll see"
Now the nightingale inspired,
Flushed with confidence, and fired
With both art and adoration,
Sang - and was a huge sensation.
Animals for miles around
Flocked towards the magic sound,
And the frog with great precision
Counted heads and charged admission.
Though next morning it was raining,
He began her vocal training.
"But I can't sing in this weather"
"Come my dear - we'll sing together.
Just put on your scarf and sash,
Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! "
So the frog and nightingale
Journeyed up and down the scale
For six hours, till she was shivering
and her voice was hoarse and quivering.
Though subdued and sleep deprived,
In the night her throat revived,
And the sumac tree was bowed,
With a breathless, titled crowd:
Owl of Sandwich, Duck of Kent,
Mallard and Milady Trent,
Martin Cardinal Mephisto,
And the Coot of Monte Cristo,
Ladies with tiaras glittering
In the interval sat twittering -
And the frog observed them glitter
With a joy both sweet and bitter.
Every day the frog who'd sold her
Songs for silver tried to scold her:
"You must practice even longer
Till your voice, like mine grows stronger.
In the second song last night
You got nervous in mid-flight.
And, my dear, lay on more trills:
Audiences enjoy such frills.
You must make your public happier:
Give them something sharper snappier.
We must aim for better billings.
You still owe me sixty shillings."
Day by day the nightingale
Grew more sorrowful and pale.
Night on night her tired song
Zipped and trilled and bounced along,
Till the birds and beasts grew tired
At a voice so uninspired
And the ticket office gross
Crashed, and she grew more morose -
For her ears were now addicted
To applause quite unrestricted,
And to sing into the night
All alone gave no delight.
Now the frog puffed up with rage.
"Brainless bird - you're on the stage -
Use your wits and follow fashion.
Puff your lungs out with your passion."
Trembling, terrified to fail,
Blind with tears, the nightingale
Heard him out in silence, tried,
Puffed up, burst a vein, and died.
Said the frog: "I tried to teach her,
But she was a stupid creature -
Far too nervous, far too tense.
Far too prone to influence.
Well, poor bird - she should have known
That your song must be your own.
That's why I sing with panache:
"Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! "
And the foghorn of the frog
Blared unrivalled through the bog.
You've probably heard the story of the scorpion who asked the frog
to help him cross the river by giving him a lift on the frog's back.
The frog refused but finally gave in after the scorpion promised he would not sting the frog, but he ultimately did.
I am a different frog, who trusted a clever scorpion, who wore a lab's mask. In my case the scorpion's sting did not kill me, it only wounded me, causing me to run away to safety.
And now the scorpion is back again, trying to gain my trust,
but his crocodile tears no longer face me.
I realize he can't help his heart, his rotten nature.
This little frog has learned, not everyone that cries is nice,
not every sweet word is true, not everyone has my best interest
at heart, and that will save my life.
A frog and a tarantula is an unusual pair,
In a hole up a tree they're happy to share.
The dotted humming frog has poisonous skin,
So he's safe from succumbing to his hairy kin.
He protects the spider's clutch of eggs,
From ants attracted to her insect dregs.
There's mutual benefit from this clever deal,
For ants are this frog's favorite meal.
The spider scares the snakes away,
To look elsewhere for their prey.
It's a wonder how this sister and brother,
Have learnt to help one another.
If you want to see these splendid two,
Take a trip to the jungle in South East Peru.
Come, said the frog to the toad,
let us hop down to the pond,
at the end of the road.
Jump on to a giant lily leaf,
and watch the fish,
as they swim underneath.
Dine on the succulent dragon flies,
see the  the world,
as it drifts by.
Then at the end of the day,
we can gaze at the stars,
watch the moon,
as it passes mars.
Come said the frog to the toad.

'Welcome to this well,
My friend, please tell
How big is your sea-well? '
Asked a frog in the well.
The sea isn't a well,
And has no circular wall
Why don't you go and see? '
Said the frog of the sea.
'No, if there's no wall
As tall as this well,
The sea water will
Seep out as well.'
'You'll go to the hell,
To me, if you again tell
That sea has no wall.'
Said the frog in the well.
Aren't there village folks
Even today, in their walks
Of life full of darkness
About the scientific progress?
Ask some of them why
An eclipse on the sky,
Of Solar or Lunar?
This'll be their answer.
'With its mouth wide open,
A serpent swallows the sun
Or the moon, causing eclipse.'
What an unbelievable nonsense?
'The end of the world is near.
Let people start their prayer
On the nearby mountain
As the catastrophe is certain.'
Some run up and down,
So saying to every one,
For this danger unseen
By the people, not keen.
The scientific knowledge
Should reach every village.
Then will there dwell
Any frog in the well?
Jacques the chef ordered it
The livestock removed bit by bit
My pond has been drained
Nothing now remains
He wanted frogs legs for his menu
No green creatures are now in situe
Most of my pals limbs have been eaten
But I've escaped - unbeaten
Give me time to recouperate
I might even find a new mate
I'll be back
Just don't tell Jacques!
There once was a frog,
Who sat on a log,
And didn't know what to do.
He looked around,
Sat on the ground,
Then saw the birds flying above.
The birds were high,
High in the sky,
And looked like they wouldn't come down.
The frog watched and stared,
Then got scared,
Then he ran off into to town.
What a wonderful bird the frog are!
When he stands he sit almost;
When he hop he fly almost.
He ain't got no sense hardly;
He ain't got no tail hardly either.
When he sit, he sits on what he ain't got almost.
Be kind and tender to the Frog,
And do not call him names,
As 'Slimy skin,' or 'Polly-wog,'
Or likewise 'Ugly James,'
Or 'Gap-a-grin,' or 'Toad-gone-wrong,'
Or 'Bill Bandy-knees':
The Frog is justly sensitive
To epithets like these.
No animal will more repay
A treatment kind and fair;
At least so lonely people say
Who keep a frog (and, by the way,
They are extremely rare).
I heard a strange noise, very loud
Between the high shinning grass
Which looked like a very tall crowd
In a green ceremonial mass
I searched for the noisy source
And to my surprise I found
A frog dancing with incredible force
On the hard, soiled ground
The emerald frog shook his left leg
Spun around and waved his arms
Hopped twice like he was about to beg
And croaked loud, causing many alarms
He shook his hip 'round and 'round
And sang out loud with all his might
Between the grass, on the ground
The frog danced, Oh what a sight!
Comes to mind as another small
upheaval
amongst the rubble.
His eye matches exactly the bubble
in my spirit-level.
I set aside hammer and chisel
and take him on the trowel.
The entire population of Ireland
springs from a pair left to stand
overnight in a pond
in the gardens of Trinity College,
two bottle of wine left there to chill
after the Act of Union.
There is, surely, in this story
a moral.  A moral for our times.
What if I put him to my head
and squeezed it out of him,
like the juice of freshly squeezed limes,
or a lemon sorbet?
Anonymous submission.
Leap frog,
Jump frog,
Everywhere you go frog,
Smile frog,
Croak frog,
Everywhere you go frog,
stomp, stomp, stomp
SQUASH! ! !
Bye, bye frog.
Week after week it shrank and shrank
as the fierce drought fiend drank and drank,
till on the bone-dry bed revealed
the mud peeled;
but now tonight is steamy-warm,
heavy with hint of thunderstorm.
And hark! hark! hoarse and harsh
the throaty croak of the frogs in the marsh:
"Wake! wake! awake! awake!
The drought break!"
but no, that chorus seems to me
more a primeval harmony.
The thunder booms, the floods flow
blended with deeper din below,
and every time the skies crash
the swamps flash!
and the whole place will be tonight
a pandemonium of delight.
Frau Doktor,
Mama Brundig,
take out your contacts,
remove your wig.
I write for you.
I entertain.
But frogs come out
of the sky like rain.
Frogs arrive
With an ugly fury.
You are my judge.
You are my jury.
My guilts are what
we catalogue.
I’ll take a knife
and chop up frog.
Frog has not nerves.
Frog is as old as a cockroach.
Frog is my father’s genitals.
Frog is a malformed doorknob.
Frog is a soft bag of green.
The moon will not have him.
The sun wants to shut off
like a light bulb.
At the sight of him
the stone washes itself in a tub.
The crow thinks he’s an apple
and drops a worm in.
At the feel of frog
the touch-me-nots explode
like electric slugs.
Slime will have him.
Slime has made him a house.
Mr. Poison
is at my bed.
He wants my sausage.
He wants my bread.
Mama Brundig,
he wants my beer.
He wants my Christ
for a souvenir.
Frog has boil disease
and a bellyful of parasites.
He says: Kiss me. Kiss me.
And the ground soils itself.
Why
should a certain
quite adorable princess
be walking in her garden
at such a time
and toss her golden ball
up like a bubble
and drop it into the well?
It was ordained.
Just as the fates deal out
the plague with a tarot card.
Just as the Supreme Being drills
holes in our skulls to let
the Boston Symphony through.
But I digress.
A loss has taken place.
The ball has sunk like a cast-iron pot
into the bottom of the well.
Lost, she said,
my moon, my butter calf,
my yellow moth, my Hindu hare.
Obviously it was more than a ball.
Balls such as these are not
for sale in Au Bon Marché.
I took the moon, she said,
between my teeth
and now it is gone
and I am lost forever.
A thief had robbed by day.
Suddenly the well grew
thick and boiling
and a frog appeared.
His eyes bulged like two peas
and his body was trussed into place.
Do not be afraid, Princess,
he said, I am not a vagabond,
a cattle farmer, a shepherd,
a doorkeeper, a postman
or a laborer.
I come to you as a tradesman.
I have something to sell.
Your ball, he said,
for just three things.
Let me eat from your plate.
Let me drink from your cup.
Let me sleep in your bed.
She thought, Old Waddler,
those three you will never do,
but she made the promises
with hopes for her ball once more.
He brought it up in his mouth
like a tricky old dog
and she ran back to the castle
leaving the frog quite alone.
That evening at dinner time
a knock was heard on the castle door
and a voice demanded:
King’s youngest daughter,
let me in. You promised;
now open to me.
I have left the skunk cabbage
and the eels to live with you.
The kind then heard her promise
and forced her to comply.
The frog first sat on her lap.
He was as awful as an undertaker.
Next he was at her plate
looking over her bacon
and calves’ liver.
We will eat in tandem,
he said gleefully.
Her fork trembled
as if a small machine
had entered her.
He sat upon the liver
and partook like a gourmet.
The princess choked
as if she were eating a puppy.
From her cup he drank.
It wasn’t exactly hygienic.
From her cup she drank
as if it were Socrates’ hemlock.
Next came the bed.
The silky royal bed.
Ah! The penultimate hour!
There was the pillow
with the princess breathing
and there was the sinuous frog
riding up and down beside her.
I have been lost in a river
of shut doors, he said,
and I have made my way over
the wet stones to live with you.
She woke up aghast.
I suffer for birds and fireflies
but not frogs, she said,
and threw him across the room.
Kaboom!
Like a genie coming out of a samovar,
a handsome prince arose in the
corner of her bedroom.
He had kind eyes and hands
and was a friend of sorrow.
Thus they were married.
After all he had compromised her.
He hired a night watchman
so that no one could enter the chamber
and he had the well
boarded over so that
never again would she lose her ball,
that moon, that Krishna hair,
that blind poppy, that innocent globe,
that madonna womb.
As I was walking through the wood
One warm and sunny summer day,
I chanced upon a  lovely sight
A swirl of butterflies in flight;
Urged on by curiosity,
I followed down the path they flew
And tumbled through a hidden door
Beneath the leafy woodland floor;
A wondrous sight did then appear
As if by magic to my eyes,
And there within a hollow log
I spied a very princely frog;
Nestled deep within that place
Of musty darkness shone a light,
And there I saw as I did look
A princely frog with poem book;
Lounging in his comfy space
With spectacles perched on his nose,
The frog prince reading unaware
Of being watched as I stood there;
So engrossed within his book,
He did not notice as I sneaked
Behind his chair on velvet feet -
Then all at once our eyes did meet
He dropped the book into his lap,
Complete surprise upon his face -
I turned to run and he did follow
Leaping from his hidden hollow
Swift I ran around the tree
And hiding, waited patiently
And soon he lept upon a rock
And then this frog began to talk;
'My dear, within your book I've read,
Your songs of love and gratitude,
Your tales of woe, of joy and such
I must admit, I like it much! '
But there is one thing I would ask
If I may only be so bold,
Now would you please consider this,
And place upon my lips a kiss?
Well, I believe in fairytales
For heaven knows I've read a few,
And if my memory serves me well,
A little kiss might break the spell;
So, pucker up you ugly frog
Let's get this done while in the mood,
I closed my eyes and then did place
A kiss upon his slimey face;
It wasn't bad, he tasted sweet!
I can't believe I kissed a frog!
My eyes did open then and see
A handsome prince smile back at me!
The prince of poets had been freed,
No longer bound beneath the spell -
And in his freedom I did find
A gentle prince, sincere and kind;
He offered then to mentor me
As poet prince, no longer frog -
And I of course said 'yes' and more...............
That day beneath the woodland floor.
New hills in the Septembers the houses get out
Their drinking glasses to remember—
Trying to forget that they never kissed their husbands
Or whomever in a zoo—
Wet mouthed on the weekend of soggy letters—
The sunlight in ridges and ridges surrounding them—
The birds, oily winged—singing,
Christmas hallucinations—places to take off—
Multiple regresses in the bluer than azure grasses—
The echoes of their children like wind chimes
Saying that they are safely upon their way to school
And now is the time to enjoy all of this—
In the wetlands, in the Peitas of the frog princes.
Is the life lived of a belching frog,
More important than the one...
Sitting quietly on a lily pad,
Looking at its reflection...
On a mirror smooth pond?
Or is the frog that belches,
Showing more appreciation...
For the flies that are attracted.
And the reason that a belching frog,
Could care less about an image reflected.
But expresses a gratefulness for the feast,
Available to be eaten.
a frog
who is never given the pond
that he deserves
cannot appreciate
what beauty is,
and the white crane
whose beauty you
adore
who takes frogs
for dinner
of course
shall never be
his goddess
When I was a kid
I caught a poison dart frog;
Its skin was golden!
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I send yoiu these flowers
To show my love for you
Love from the prince
Im kissed
Violets are blue
Roses are red
I send you these flowers
I'm waiting in bed
Love from froggie
I 'd like to speak, told me a frog
about this shadow in the fog
this shadow that is following us
without haste, hurry, or rush
I 'd like to speak, but its forbidden
to tell and to reveal the end
of  a story never read
never begun and never written.
By day, this well-contented frog
Has made his home on yonder log,
Nipping at flies with rounded ribbit-
Grumble
But I've heard tales of the frog by night,
Lit up in limey lunar light,
As dizzy glow worms dip and tight-
Rope tumble:
In glittering waistcoat and top hat,
Beside a leotarded bat,
The frog becomes an acrobat-
Ic wonder!
This have I heard, but is it true?
The frog will not tell me or you -
Just sits and croaks and leaves us two
To ponder.
Three men I saw beside a bar,
Regarding o'er their bottle,
A frog who smoked a rank cigar
They'd jammed within its throttle.
A Pasha frog it must have been
So big it as and bloated;
And from its lips the nicotine
In graceful festoon floated.
And while the trio jeered and joked,
As if it quite enjoyed it,
Impassively it smoked and smoked,
(It could now well avoid it).
A ring of fire its lips were nigh
Yet it seemed all unwitting;
It could not spit, like you and I,
Who've learned the art of spitting.
It did not wink, it did not shrink,
As there serene it squatted'
Its eyes were clear, it did not fear
The fate the Gods allotted.
It squatted there with calm sublime,
Amid their cruel guying;
Grave as a god, and all the time
It knew that it was dying.
And somehow then it seemed to me
These men expectorating,
Were infinitely less than he,
The dumb thing they were baiting.
It seemed to say, despite their jokes:
"This is my hour of glory.
It isn't every frog that smokes:
My name will live in story."
Before its nose the smoke arose;
The flame grew nigher, nigher;
And then I saw its bright eyes close
Beside that ring of fire.
They turned it on its warty back,
From off its bloated belly;
It legs jerked out, then dangled slack;
It quivered like a jelly.
And then the fellows went away,
Contented with their joking;
But even as in death it lay,
The frog continued smoking.
Life's like a lighted fag, thought I;
We smoke it stale; then after
Death turns our belly to the sky:
The Gods must have their laughter.
Cobra sings in Swahili 'What a beautiful creature are you? This world is so vast and you stuck in a deep well for nothing, come out honey in a rainy day.'
'Though I am a huge reptile my heart is very soft sweetheart and I can teach you a knot when you hide in my bosom.' Python boasts.
'I may be a venomous serpent but I never sting your heart my darling.'
Viper whispers.
'Thank you very much my dear friends and I am so grateful for your intimacy, I wait for heavy rains and when there is an overflow I could have come out from this dungeon into your strange world.' Frog utters a Guttural note.

toad frog and their little son tadpole
were so happy pleased and proud
when their home in the far swamp
they did eventually newly renovate
the sun shone sparkling through
their neat rural aquatic homestead
like a friendly radiant bright crisp
clean vibrant yellow golden gate
illuminates intricate filigree lacy patterns
on their carefully arranged plants and flowers
happily they would together all sit outside
sucking in flies merrily for hours and hours
oh happy happy merry summer swamp scene
to renovate their aquatic home was their dream
this little corner swamp swept all spic and span
beauty still saved yet from dread destructive man

The frog by nature is both damp and cold,
Her mouth is large, her belly much will hold;
She sits somewhat ascending, loves to be
Croaking in gardens, though unpleasantly.
Comparison.
The hypocrite is like unto this frog,
As like as is the puppy to the dog.
He is of nature cold, his mouth is wide
To prate, and at true goodness to deride.
He mounts his head as if he was above
The world, when yet 'tis that which has his love.
And though he seeks in churches for to croak,
He neither loveth Jesus nor his yoke.
The old watch: their
thick eyes
puff and foreclose by the moon.The young, heads
trailed by the beginnings of necks,
shiver,
in the guarantee they shall be bodies.
In the frog pond
the vapor trail of a SAC bomber creeps,
I hear its drone, drifting, high up
in immaculate ozone.
I have a pet frog
We go frog walking every day at 6pm
He is fine until he sees another frog
He sniffs & then tries to jump
I pull him away
Last week we had a problem
My frog stopped to do his business
A passer bye said stop your frog fouling
I cleared up after him but it left a slimy mark
The other man slipped on it
My frog likes water
Especially ponds
He likes jumping on lilies
The local gardener is mad
Control your frog he shouts
Well now Im in trouble
Despite the sign
Beware of the FROG
He bit a policeman
A fine guard frog
My frog is now banned
From walks anywhere
Poor froggy is in a cell
Eating flies & drinking water
Its a frogs life
I can see that
water frog
In a pond
Frogs sing lullaby
Noise whacking the rainy night
Inspiration snooze
(In memory of Stephen (Reggie)   Pearce
of Kilnsea,1980–2005)
The wind blows cold through the churchyard trees
and sadly tolls the passing bell
as mourners shuffle up the leaf-strewn
narrow path between the leaning stones.
He was just twenty-five, so young,
so full of life, and love of life
and laughter — killed outright one night
in a head-on crash on his motorbike.
From far and wide we’ve gathered here
to pay respect to our young friend.
I’ve never seen the church so full,
oh death, how can you be so cruel?
Who will forget this funeral?
Four hundred strong in the nave we stood,
family and friends both young and old
and a phalanx of bikers in leathers and boots.
Between the holy platitudes
and hymns they played his favourite songs;
one had to smile to hear within
that ancient august church of stone
come belting out the vibrant tones
of modern rock and heavy metal.
Who can forget the coffin passing
in procession like a royal barque,
the biker’s helmet on its lid
resplendent in heraldic tones
— rich gules, azure, argent, or,
a shining light of knightly splendour?
Who will forget that send-off from
his fellow bikers when three score
or more bright gleaming motorcycles
with a thunderous roar led off the hearse?
They have arrived again my friend!
To be with us again
To claim bond of relations with the deceased
As if they were blood bond relatives with the fallen blood
You see, with their crocodile faces and tears they landed
Pretending to be generous.
With their uncircumcised heart and coordinated prayers
They smell what the fallen brother has left.
Look at their leaking mouth
For the visit of death erects their ears.
This poem tells how people go for burial or funeral with their different motives and interests especially in Africa.
After the funeral, mule praises, brays,
Windshake of sailshaped ears, muffle-toed tap
Tap happily of one peg in the thick
Grave's foot, blinds down the lids, the teeth in black,
The spittled eyes, the salt ponds in the sleeves,
Morning smack of the spade that wakes up sleep,
Shakes a desolate boy who slits his throat
In the dark of the coffin and sheds dry leaves,
That breaks one bone to light with a judgment clout'
After the feast of tear-stuffed time and thistles
In a room with a stuffed fox and a stale fern,
I stand, for this memorial's sake, alone
In the snivelling hours with dead, humped Ann
Whose hodded, fountain heart once fell in puddles
Round the parched worlds of Wales and drowned each sun
(Though this for her is a monstrous image blindly
Magnified out of praise; her death was a still drop;
She would not have me sinking in the holy
Flood of her heart's fame; she would lie dumb and deep
And need no druid of her broken body).
But I, Ann's bard on a raised hearth, call all
The seas to service that her wood-tongud virtue
Babble like a bellbuoy over the hymning heads,
Bow down the walls of the ferned and foxy woods
That her love sing and swing through a brown chapel,
Blees her bent spirit with four, crossing birds.
Her flesh was meek as milk, but this skyward statue
With the wild breast and blessed and giant skull
Is carved from her in a room with a wet window
In a fiercely mourning house in a crooked year.
I know her scrubbed and sour humble hands
Lie with religion in their cramp, her threadbare
Whisper in a damp word, her wits drilled hollow,
Her fist of a face died clenched on a round pain;
And sculptured Ann is seventy years of stone.
These cloud-sopped, marble hands, this monumental
Argument of the hewn voice, gesture and psalm
Storm me forever over her grave until
The stuffed lung of the fox twitch and cry Love
And the strutting fern lay seeds on the black sill.
Pale, at its ghastly noon,
Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon;
The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs;
The clouds descend in rain;
Mourning, the wan stars wane,
Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres!
Haggard as spectres--vision-like and dumb,
Dark with the pomp of death, and moving slow,
Towards that sad lair the pale procession come
Where the grave closes on the night below.
With dim, deep-sunken eye,
Crutched on his staff, who trembles tottering by?
As wrung from out the shattered heart, one groan
Breaks the deep hush alone!
Crushed by the iron fate, he seems to gather
All life's last strength to stagger to the bier,
And hearken--Do these cold lips murmur "Father?"
The sharp rain, drizzling through that place of fear,
Pierces the bones gnawed fleshless by despair,
And the heart's horror stirs the silver hair.
Fresh bleed the fiery wounds
Through all that agonizing heart undone--
Still on the voiceless lips "my Father" sounds,
And still the childless Father murmurs "Son!"
Ice-cold--ice-cold, in that white shroud he lies--
Thy sweet and golden dreams all vanished there--
The sweet and golden name of "Father" dies
Into thy curse,--ice-cold--ice-cold--he lies!
Dead, what thy life's delight and Eden were!
Mild, as when, fresh from the arms of Aurora,
While the air like Elysium is smiling above,
Steeped in rose-breathing odors, the darling of Flora
Wantons over the blooms on his winglets of love.
So gay, o'er the meads, went his footsteps in bliss,
The silver wave mirrored the smile of his face;
Delight, like a flame, kindled up at his kiss,
And the heart of the maid was the prey of his chase.
Boldly he sprang to the strife of the world,
As a deer to the mountain-top carelessly springs;
As an eagle whose plumes to the sun are unfurled,
Swept his hope round the heaven on its limitless wings.
Proud as a war-horse that chafes at the rein,
That, kingly, exults in the storm of the brave;
That throws to the wind the wild stream of its mane,
Strode he forth by the prince and the slave!
Life like a spring day, serene and divine,
In the star of the morning went by as a trance;
His murmurs he drowned in the gold of the wine,
And his sorrows were borne on the wave of the dance.
Worlds lay concealed in the hopes of his youth!--
When once he shall ripen to manhood and fame!
Fond father exult!--In the germs of his youth
What harvests are destined for manhood and fame!
Not to be was that manhood!--The death-bell is knelling,
The hinge of the death-vault creaks harsh on the ears--
How dismal, O Death, is the place of thy dwelling!
Not to be was that manhood!--Flow on, bitter tears!
Go, beloved, thy path to the sun,
Rise, world upon world, with the perfect to rest;
Go--quaff the delight which thy spirit has won,
And escape from our grief in the Halls of the Blest.
Again (in that thought what a healing is found!)
To meet in the Eden to which thou art fled!--
Hark, the coffin sinks down with a dull, sullen sound,
And the ropes rattle over the sleep of the dead.
And we cling to each other!--O Grave, he is thine!
The eye tells the woe that is mute to the ears--
And we dare to resent what we grudge to resign,
Till the heart's sinful murmur is choked in its tears.
Pale at its ghastly noon,
Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon!
The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs:
The clouds descend in rain;
Mourning, the wan stars wane,
Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres.
The dull clods swell into the sullen mound;
Earth, one look yet upon the prey we gave!
The grave locks up the treasure it has found;
Higher and higher swells the sullen mound--
Never gives back the grave!
i carefully place
myself on the pyre of
dreams that desert me
from time to time...
my ears intently tune
themselves to hear
the message of futility
conveyed through
the crackling of chips
everywhere on this island
insulated by the salt waters
my soul roams about in
desperation for a release

Early darkness; as oil we drip on tarmac,
a gathering in black fallen from the sky.
With lemon faces we shadow the next.
Tears empty and clear; cutting out the jabber
still alive we drift over cobbles. Arms alongside
too distant and too close, much too close.
The crows send us back into the rain,
a brass aside breaks the ring, a hole in life.
We stare into; is that all?
Destitute in my thoughts,
I found myself removed that day.
There he was,
lying cold
And just ten.
A bloody shame.
It’s hard to quite grasp
the feeling first
encountered
upon the image of a corpse.
Shock, fear,
and a deep sadness:
the inevitable frailty of life.
A “corpse” I thought.
This little man
Once a name,
Now as ice and plastic,
what have you become?
I remember how he used to make me smile,
And the way he would tease his dog “Abby”.
They say animals recognize the soul,
His was a gentle one…
Just a child,
unaware of the pain the world can bring.
He was too young to know fear,
And her touch had not yet corrupted him.
A bloody shame.
Amongst the crowd were mourners,
Little children and adults.
They had come to see their friend,
But children should never know this pain.
They brought toys, flowers
and the hope of the
lives they would lead.
Tiny hands, and tiny feet,
while
his remained cold.
In and out they paid their respects,
“oh it’s a shame” and
“he was so young”.
And then back to life.
My uncle stood alone.
Your pain will never be removed,
And for that I'm sorry,
A bloody shame.

I can see all things now.
I can see so many tears.
I can see so much pain, In so many faces.
I can see it all so clearly now.
I can sense the pain,
In the souls passing by.
I can feel hearts breaking,
I can feel so much sorrow, that shouldn't be.
Please don't weep, not for me.
I am so much better off now.
Can you believe, I am actually happy.
I can see everything so clearly now.
Look up, see the leaves as they move,
See the clouds as they float by.
Feel the wind on your face,
Taste the rain on your tongue.
It is me.
I still exist.
I will always be with you.
I still exist.

Through airy roads he wings his instant flight
To purer regions of celestial light;
Enlarg'd he sees unnumber'd systems roll,
Beneath him sees the universal whole,
Planets on planets run their destin'd round,
And circling wonders fill the vast profound.
Th' ethereal now, and now th' empyreal skies
With growing splendors strike his wond'ring eyes:
The angels view him with delight unknown,
Press his soft hand, and seat him on his throne;
Then smilling thus: 'To this divine abode,
'The seat of saints, of seraphs, and of God,
'Thrice welcome thou.'  The raptur'd babe replies,
'Thanks to my God, who snatch'd me to the skies,
'E'er vice triumphant had possess'd my heart,
'E'er yet the tempter had beguil d my heart,
'E'er yet on sin's base actions I was bent,
'E'er yet I knew temptation's dire intent;
'E'er yet the lash for horrid crimes I felt,
'E'er vanity had led my way to guilt,
'But, soon arriv'd at my celestial goal,
'Full glories rush on my expanding soul.'
Joyful he spoke: exulting cherubs round
Clapt their glad wings, the heav'nly vaults resound.
Say, parents, why this unavailing moan?
Why heave your pensive bosoms with the groan?
To Charles, the happy subject of my song,
A brighter world, and nobler strains belong.
Say would you tear him from the realms above
By thoughtless wishes, and prepost'rous love?
Doth his felicity increase your pain?
Or could you welcome to this world again
The heir of bliss? with a superior air
Methinks he answers with a smile severe,
'Thrones and dominions cannot tempt me there.'
But still you cry, 'Can we the sigh borbear,
'And still and still must we not pour the tear?
'Our only hope, more dear than vital breath,
'Twelve moons revolv'd, becomes the prey of death;
'Delightful infant, nightly visions give
'Thee to our arms, and we with joy receive,
'We fain would clasp the Phantom to our breast,
'The Phantom flies, and leaves the soul unblest.'
To yon bright regions let your faith ascend,
Prepare to join your dearest infant friend
In pleasures without measure, without end.
WITH steady march across the daisy meadow,
And by the churchyard wall we go;
But leave behind, beneath the linden shadow,
One, who no more will rise and go:
Farewell, our brother, here sleeping in dust,
Till thou shalt wake again, wake with the just.
Along the street where neighbor nods to neighbor,
Along the busy street we throng,
Once more to laugh, to live and love and labor,--
But he will be remembered long:
Sleep well, our brother, though sleeping in dust:
Shalt thou not rise again--rise with the just?
Farewell, true heart and kindly hand, left lying
Where wave the linden branches calm;
'T is his to live, and ours to wait for dying,
We win, while he has won, the palm;
Farewell, our brother! But one day, we trust,
Call--he will answer Thee, God of the just.
Let us begin and carry up this corpse,
Singing together.
Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar thorpes
Each in its tether
Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain,
Cared-for till cock-crow:
Look out if yonder be not day again
Rimming the rock-row!
That's the appropriate country; there, man's thought,
Rarer, intenser,
Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it ought,
Chafes in the censer.
Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop;
Seek we sepulture
On a tall mountain, citied to the top,
Crowded with culture!
All the peaks soar, but one the rest excels;
Clouds overcome it;
No! yonder sparkle is the citadel's
Circling its summit.
Thither our path lies; wind we up the heights:
Wait ye the warning?
Our low life was the level's and the night's;
He's for the morning.
Step to a tune, square chests, erect each head,
'Ware the beholders!
This is our master, famous, calm and dead,
Borne on our shoulders.
Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and croft,
Safe from the weather!
He, whom we convoy to his grave aloft,
Singing together,
He was a man born with thy face and throat,
Lyric Apollo!
Long he lived nameless: how should spring take note
Winter would follow?
Till lo, the little touch, and youth was gone!
Cramped and diminished,
Moaned he, "New measures, other feet anon!
My dance is finished"?
No, that's the world's way: (keep the mountain-side,
Make for the city!)
He knew the signal, and stepped on with pride
Over men's pity;
Left play for work, and grappled with the world
Bent on escaping:
"What's in the scroll," quoth he, "thou keepest furled
Show me their shaping,
Theirs who most studied man, the bard and sage,--
Give!"--So, he gowned him,
Straight got by heart that book to its last page:
Learned, we found him.
Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like lead,
Accents uncertain:
"Time to taste life," another would have said,
"Up with the curtain!"
This man said rather, "Actual life comes next?
Patience a moment!
Grant I have mastered learning's crabbed text,
Still there's the comment.
Let me know all! Prate not of most or least,
Painful or easy!
Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up the feast,
Ay, nor feel queasy."
Oh, such a life as he resolved to live,
When he had learned it,
When he had gathered all books had to give!
Sooner, he spurned it.
Image the whole, then execute the parts--
Fancy the fabric
Quite, ere you build, ere steel strike fire from quartz,
Ere mortar dab brick!
(Here's the town-gate reached: there's the market-place
Gaping before us.)
Yea, this in him was the peculiar grace
(Hearten our chorus!)
That before living he'd learn how to live--
No end to learning:
Earn the means first--God surely will contrive
Use for our earning.
Others mistrust and say, "But time escapes:
Live now or never!"
He said, "What's time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!
Man has Forever."
Back to his book then: deeper drooped his head:
Calculus racked him:
Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of lead:
Tussis attacked him.
"Now, master, take a little rest!"--not he!
(Caution redoubled
Step two abreast, the way winds narrowly!)
Not a whit troubled,
Back to his studies, fresher than at first,
Fierce as a dragon
He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst)
Sucked at the flagon.
Oh, if we draw a circle premature,
Heedless of far gain,
Greedy for quick returns of profit, sure
Bad is our bargain!
Was it not great? did not he throw on God,
(He loves the burthen)--
God's task to make the heavenly period
Perfect the earthen?
Did not he magnify the mind, show clear
Just what it all meant?
He would not discount life, as fools do here,
Paid by instalment.
He ventured neck or nothing--heaven's success
Found, or earth's failure:
"Wilt thou trust death or not?" He answered "Yes:
Hence with life's pale lure!"
That low man seeks a little thing to do,
Sees it and does it:
This high man, with a great thing to pursue,
Dies ere he knows it.
That low man goes on adding one to one,
His hundred's soon hit:
This high man, aiming at a million,
Misses an unit.
That, has the world here--should he need the next,
Let the world mind him!
This, throws himself on God, and unperplexed
Seeking shall find him.
So, with the throttling hands of death at strife,
Ground he at grammar;
Still, thro' the rattle, parts of speech were rife:
While he could stammer
He settled Hoti's business--let it be!--
Properly based Oun--
Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic De,
Dead from the waist down.
Well, here's the platform, here's the proper place:
Hail to your purlieus,
All ye highfliers of the feathered race,
Swallows and curlews!
Here's the top-peak; the multitude below
Live, for they can, there:
This man decided not to Live but Know--
Bury this man there?
Here--here's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds form,
Lightnings are loosened,
Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,
Peace let the dew send!
Lofty designs must close in like effects:
Loftily lying,
Leave him--still loftier than the world suspects,
Living and dying.
From the slow march and muffled drum,
And crowds distrest,
And book and bell, at length I have come
To my full rest.
A ten years' rule beneath the sun
Is wound up here,
And what I have done, what left undone,
Figures out clear.
Yet in the estimate of such
It grieves me more
That I by some was loved so much
Than that I bore,
From others, judgment of that hue
Which over-hope
Breeds from a theoretic view
Of regal scope.
For kingly opportunities
Right many have sighed;
How best to bear its devilries
Those learn who have tried!
I have eaten the fat and drunk the sweet,
Lived the life out
From the first greeting glad drum-beat
To the last shout.
What pleasure earth affords to kings
I have enjoyed
Through its long vivid pulse-stirrings
Even till it cloyed.
What days of strain, what nights of stress
Can cark a throne,
Even one maintained in peacefulness,
I too have known.
And so, I think, could I step back
To life again,
I should prefer the average track
Of average men,
Since, as with them, what kingship would
It cannot do,
Nor to first thoughts however good
Hold itself true.
Something binds hard the royal hand,
As all that be,
And it is That has shaped, has planned
My acts and me.
I often tell my beloved,
Please adorn me with beautiful,
Jasmine flowers.
Like a lovely bride, I should look.
Once, I had long shining silky hair,
And I loved to wear jasmine flowers,
But I cut my hair short.
But don't be stingy
Tuck jasmine flowers only, in my hair.
Cover me with kanjeepuram sari only,
Else I will question you.
As I love to look today,
Like a beautiful bride.
Cover me with full of fragrance,
As I love perfumes,
My eyes to be beautifully drawn with,
Eye Liner.
Of course, be careful as it may hurt me too.
No lipstick as I don't like.
Yeah but scented talcum powder would be fine for me.
And one big bindi on my forehead.
And a small sandal wood paste on top of it.
I should look like a beautiful bride.
Ain't I?
Don't wake up the bride.
She is in her deep sleep....
Let her sleep!
Note..In this poem, I portrayed a scene of a woman whose husband fulfils her last death wishes. Like a bride she was decorated and taken for funeral. Thats why I said last lines...let her sleep...

Give us, God, to Thee now turning,
Fullness of joy, tears full and burning,
Of will the full refining fire!
Hear our prayer o'er his inurning:
His will was
one
, the whole discerning,
His whole soul would to it aspire.
Yes; give us yet again,
With power to lead, great men,-
Power in counsel our folk to lead,
Our folk in deed,
Our folk in gladness and in need!
Thou, O God, our want preventest;
To raise the temple
him
Thou lentest,
A spirit bright and pure and great.
When Thou from time to call him meantest,
Her tender soul to him Thou sentest
Who went before to heaven's gate.
When Thou didst set him free,
An epoch ceased to be.
Men then marveled, the while they said:
'Living and dead,
O'er all our land he beauty spread.'
Help us, God, to wiser waring,
When to our land Thou light art bearing,
That we Thy dayspring then may know.
God, our future Thou'rt preparing,
Oh, give us longing, honor's daring,
That we the great may not forego!
Thou sentest many out,-
Cease not, our God, nor doubt!
Let us follow Thy way, Thy call,
Men, words, and all!
Thy mercies shall our North enwall!
26/10/10 a poets funeral
On a very humid Tuesday morning
A cavalcade of cars slowly move by
Rose petals on the hot black tarmac
Like words from his directory of verse
Or tear drops for the one now beyond his time
Then the poet himself comes grinning wide
Enjoying the ambulance wind shield ride
Even as most of him lay inside properly iced
The poet whom the state briefly forgot
In his dying days – a tramp in hospital corridors
Now inching towards his hour of crowning glory
To fresh garlands and stately wreaths
Before the switch is finally flipped
And he is consecrated to the elements five
A state funeral for a derelict poet
A poet who now will continue to live on ……………………..
I loved her too, this woman who is dead.
Look in my face. I have a right to go
And see the place where you have made her bed
Among the snow.
I loved her too whom you are burying.
I have a right to stand beside her bier,
And to my handful of the dust I fling,
That she may hear.
I loved her; and it was not for the eyes
Which you have shut, nor for her yellow hair,
Nor for the face which in your bosom lies.
Let it lie there!
Nor for the wild--birds' music of her voice,
Which we shall hear in dreams till we too sleep;
Nor for the rest, which made the world rejoice,
The angels weep.
It was not for the payment of sweet love,
Though love is often straitened for a kiss,
Nor for the hope of other joys above,
But only this,
That she had laid her hand upon my heart
Once in the summer time when we were young,
And that her finger--tips had left a smart,
And that my tongue
Had spoken words which might not be unspoken
Lest they should make a by--word of love's truth,
And I had sworn that love should be the token
Of my youth.
And so I gave her all, and long ago
The treasure of my youth was put in pawn;
And she was little richer that I know
When that was gone.
But I have lived a beggar since that day
And hide my face it may be from men's eyes;
For often I have seen them shrink away,
As in surprise
That such a loathsome cripple should be found
To walk abroad in daylight with the rest,
And scarce a rag to cover up the wound
Upon his breast.
Yet no man stopped to ask how this might be,
Or I had scared them, and let loose my tongue,
How I had bought myself this misery
When I was young.
Yet I have loved her. This must be my pay,
The pension I have earned me with these tears;
The right to kneel beside her grave to--day,
Despite these years,
With all her kisses burning on my cheek,
As when I left her and our love was dead,
And our lips trembled though they did not speak,
The night I fled;
The right to bid you stand aside, nor be
A witness of our meeting. Did you love
In joy as I have loved in misery?
You did not prove
Your love was stronger than the strength of death,
Or she had never died upon your hand.
I would have fed her breathing with my breath;
I would have fanned
A living wind of Heaven to her lips;
I would have stolen life from Paradise.
And she is dead, and you have seen eclipse
Within those eyes.
If I could know that you had loved her well;
If I could hold it for a certainty
That you had sold your life as I did sell;
If I could see
The blackness of your soul, and with my tongue
Taste the full bitterness of tears unshed;
If I should find your very heart was wrung
And maimed and dead;
If I should feel your hand's grasp crumble mine,
And hug the pain when I should grasp in turn;
If I could dip my fingers in the brine
Of eyes that burn;
If I could hear your voice call back the dead
With such a mighty cry of agony
That she should turn and listen in the bed
Where she doth lie,
And all the heavens should together roll,
Thinking they heard the angel's trumpet tone,
I could forget it that you bought a soul
Which was my own;
I could forget that she forgot her vows,
That aught was bartered for the wealth of love;
I could untell the story of my woes,
Till God above
Should hold her guiltless and condone the wrong
Done to His justice; I could take your hand
And call you brother, as we went along
To take our stand
Before His judgment--seat with her again
Where we are hurrying,--for we could not keep
Our place unchallenged in the ranks of men
Who do not weep.
You won't believe this, rightfully so, you'll think it’s not true
but a person will do anything, when he starts losing his screw
I didn't feel that any one loved me, so I devised one day
to test out my theory, in the most bizarre type of way
I found a way after considerable thought, to put myself on display
and to be able to stay inconspicuous, from a secure distance away
I watched them attend my eulogy, peculiar as it may sound
enjoying the reception, It was nothing short of spellbound
Who could think, a person as crazy as I might be
going to such extremes, who would ever foresee
to accomplish this great task, of convincing my heart
someone would somehow care, if I really did depart
In the back of the room, with shades covering my eyes
sinking into a chair, surrounded by this chorus of cries
who would ever suspect, that this stranger sitting in the back
was really not far away, from being deemed a quack
When my funeral was about over, I watched those flowers start to bend
they too seemed to be saying, haven't you yet been able to mend
so I pushed myself up front, in order to get a better look
this death looks too real, what if I really did pass over that final brook
As I approached my casket, overtaken by this powerful desire
could this really be happening, shaking with a cold perspire
to escape from this nightmare, there was but one thing to do
hastening to relieve myself, running from bed to bathroom, I flew
The lesson here to be learned, after thinking about it, was simple and clear
we often have these fears, and yet are not always aware
what’s important for us, is to truly recognize in ourselves, which is the key
understanding our need to feel loved, and the absurd lengths we go, in order to see
[One of the Bearers Soliloquizes:]
. . . Room in your heart for him, O Mother Earth,
Who loved each flower and leaf that made you fair,
And sang your praises in verses manifold
And delicate, with here and there a line
From end to end in blossom like a bough
The May breathes on, so rich it was. Some thought
The workmanship more costly than the thing
Moulded or carved, as in those ornaments
Found at Mycæne. And yet Nature's self
Works in this wise; upon a blade of grass,
Or what small note she lends the woodland thrush,
Lavishing endless patience. He was born
Artist, not artisan, which some few saw
And many dreamed not. As he wrote no odes
When Croesus wedded or Mæcenas died,
And gave no breath to civic feasts and shows,
He missed the glare that gilds more facile men--
A twilight poet, groping quite alone,
Belated, in a sphere where every nest
Is emptied of its music and its wings.
Not great his gift; yet we can poorly spare
Even his slight perfection in an age
Of limping triolets and tame rondeaux.
He had at least ideals, though unreached,
And heard, far off, immortal harmonies,
Such as fall coldly on our ear to-day.
The mighty Zolastic Movement now
Engrosses us--a miasmatic breath
Blown from the slums. We paint life as it is,
The hideous side of it, with careful pains,
Making a god of the dull Commonplace.
For have we not the old gods overthrown
And set up strangest idols? We would clip
Imagination's wing and kill delight,
Our sole art being to leave nothing out
That renders art offensive. Not for us
Madonnas leaning from their starry thrones
Ineffable, nor any heaven-wrought dream
Of sculptor or of poet; we prefer
Such nightmare visions as in morbid brains
Take shape and substance, thoughts that taint the air
And make all life unlovely. Will it last?
Beauty alone endures from age to age,
From age to age endures, handmaid of God.
Poets who walk with her on earth go hence
Bearing a talisman. You bury one,
With his hushed music, in some Potter's Field;
The snows and rains blot out his very name,
As he from life seems blotted; through Time's glass
Slip the invisible and magic sands
That mark the century, then falls a day
The world is suddenly conscious of a flower,
Imperishable, ever to be prized,
Sprung from the mould of a forgotten grave.
'T is said the seeds wrapt up among the balms
And hieroglyphics of Egyptian kings
old strange vitality, and, planted, grow
After the lapse of thrice a thousand years.
Some day, perchance, some unregarded note
Of our poor friend here--some sweet minor chord
That failed to lure our more accustomed ear--
Way witch the fancy of an unborn age.
Who knows, since seeds have such tenacity?
Meanwhile he's dead, with scantiest laurel won
And little of our Ninteenth Century gold.
So, take him, Earth, and this his mortal part,
With that shrewd alchemy thou hast, transmute
To flower and leaf in thine unending springs!
February 2, 1901
Her sacred body bear: the tenement
Of that strong soul now ranked with God's Elect
Her heart upon her people's heart she spent;
Hence is she Royalty's lodestar to direct.
The peace is hers, of whom all lands have praised
Majestic virtues ere her day unseen.
Aloft the name of Womanhood she raised,
And gave new readings to the Title, Queen.
AWAY with funeral music - set
The pipe to powerful lips -
The cup of life's for him that drinks
And not for him that sips.
The time has not come before
And this is new.
The light is opening for the day
An ingénue displaying her bosom
To man’s face-
I remember when
I was young in following her.
Her tassels feeling through the trees
And drinking roots,
She laughed even while
Alone;
Giggling,
She rode her bicycle across campus.
I staid up all night and prayed for her.
When tired, she slept
In the shade of a house-
Eyes half closed. I came to her,
She yawned and turned me away.
She said she loved me
Only when she was drunk,
And it was yet that time-
So long ago, yesterday....
Then early this morning she came to me
And offered me the quaff
Of lips.
Dripping nectar on the limbs,
She said, “Never before now, old man, ”
As they lowered me in the grave,
Her light budded
A valleyide of rubrum,
A wedding at my funeral.
Well, come to the new years ball,
have a fun time celebratin' the funeral of 1999...

Forty body bags thrown atop with each other
Labeled for cremation
Among them were women, men, children, fathers, mothers, sister and brothers
To be burnt to ash, that was their destination,
All rested inside a garage
Bodies decomposing
Their bodies leaked fluids through the bag
I guess they were not Zip-Lock bags
The funeral home had a contract with Georgetown Medical School,
William Chambers said that things were in disarray
What a frickin' fool!
His brother Tom denied any culpability
For this unsanitary, immoral, and most likely illegal fray.
Some of the bag tags were unidentifiable
Due to the immense leakage from the inside
The smell must've been grotesquely foul
Yet the Chambers Brothers did something wrong, you ask?
They flatly denied.
The mortuary license the Chambers had had been suspended last Friday
They have to cremate the bodies that they have in their possession
A&E should do a 'Hoarding' special series on Chambers Brothers.
So much for this observation.

By his side, whose days are past,
Lay bow and quiver!
And his eyes that stare aghast
Close, with a shiver.
God nor man from Death, at last,
Love may deliver.
Though, of old, we vowed, my dear,
Death should not take him;
Mourn not thou that we must here
Coldly forsake him;
Shed above his grave no tear,
Tears will not wake him.
Cupid lieth cold and dead,
Ended his flying,
Pale his lips, once rosy-red,
Swift was his dying.
Place a stone above his head,
Turn away, sighing.
BY his side, whose days are past,
Lay bow and quiver!
And his eyes that stare aghast
Close, with a shiver.
God nor man from Death, at last,
Love may deliver.
Though—of old—we vowed, my dear,
Death should not take him;
Mourn not thou that we must here
Coldly forsake him;
Shed above his grave no tear—
Tears will not wake him.
Cupid lieth cold and dead—
Ended his flying,
Pale his lips, once rosy-red,
Swift was his dying.
Place a stone above his head,
Turn away, sighing.
Make my funeral happy when my life as gone
Dress in rainbow colours nothing dark and drab
Smile though your hearts are aching
Send me off with a King Cole song
My darling wife all thru my life my kids and theirs
I love you all, give a toast have a dance and really stand up tall
Shed a tear of course but finish off, with a grin
Turn this into a happy day God approves it ain’t no sin
Bring on the clowns and dancers, cakes and fun
Open all the doors and fill the place with sun
Fill your hearts with joy in knowing I’m dressed in white and
Dancing in the clouds and see, my quickstep makes it rain
I promise to you all I will rest in peace if after this day
You will live every day in happiness and pursue your dreams of joy
Then if you do I assure you they will all come true...........
God bless you's all
Michael Jackson's 'SMILE' played, as the coffin entered everyone stood tall
Mum's poem was read and felt by all
The Mourners were smiling at the photo's of Mum
As the DVD played, no one was glum
Happy pictures were played of Mum's life with a tear
To the tune of the music 'If I Lay Here'
Friends got up for the Eulogy
Wonderful Words spoken of Mum... Now free
Free to move on, to follow a new life
Happy if Dad, finds a new wife
Everyone looked like they were enjoying the moment
In a room full of love; as if Heaven sent
For Mum was so kind and by all adored
Yet sadly the Funeral Conductor looked everso bored
He looked like he had something better to do
This was just a job and he really didn't care just who...
Who had died Or who was grieving
About the life of this person or the world they were leaving
So... Make sure you write.. Your Funeral Plan
It saves pain for the family, A real helping hand
You can choose your Funeral Home, coffin, Cemetery and your music too
It will take away some pain Of  losing you

LYN PAUL
MADAM—
That I might make your cabinet my tomb,
And for my fame, which I love next my soul,
Next to my soul provide the happiest room,
Admit to that place this last funeral scroll.
Others by wills give legacies, but I
Dying, of you do beg a legacy.
My fortune and my will this custom break,
When we are senseless grown to make stones speak,
Though no stone tell thee what I was, yet thou
In my grave's inside seest what thou art now,
Yet thou 'rt not yet so good ; till death us lay
To ripe and mellow there, we're stubborn clay.
Parents make us earth, and souls dignify
Us to be glass ; here to grow gold we lie.
Whilst in our souls sin bred and pamper'd is,
Our souls become worm-eaten carcases.
The coffin as I past across the lane
Came sudden on my view. It was not here,
A sight of every day, as in the streets
Of the great city, and we paus'd and ask'd
Who to the grave was going. It was one,
A village girl, they told us, who had borne
An eighteen months strange illness, and had pined
With such slow wasting that the hour of death
Came welcome to her. We pursued our way
To the house of mirth, and with that idle talk
That passes o'er the mind and is forgot,
We wore away the time. But it was eve
When homewardly I went, and in the air
Was that cool freshness, that discolouring shade
That makes the eye turn inward. Then I heard
Over the vale the heavy toll of death
Sound slow; it made me think upon the dead,
I questioned more and learnt her sorrowful tale.
She bore unhusbanded a mother's name,
And he who should have cherished her, far off
Sail'd on the seas, self-exil'd from his home,
For he was poor. Left thus, a wretched one,
Scorn made a mock of her, and evil tongues
Were busy with her name. She had one ill
Heavier, neglect, forgetfulness from him
Whom she had loved so dearly. Once he wrote,
But only once that drop of comfort came
To mingle with her cup of wretchedness;
And when his parents had some tidings from him,
There was no mention of poor Hannah there,
Or 'twas the cold enquiry, bitterer
Than silence. So she pined and pined away
And for herself and baby toil'd and toil'd,
Nor did she, even on her death bed, rest
From labour, knitting with her outstretch'd arms
Till she sunk with very weakness. Her old mother
Omitted no kind office, and she work'd
Hard, and with hardest working barely earn'd
Enough to make life struggle and prolong
The pains of grief and sickness. Thus she lay
On the sick bed of poverty, so worn
With her long suffering and that painful thought
That at her heart lay rankling, and so weak,
That she could make no effort to express
Affection for her infant; and the child,
Whose lisping love perhaps had solaced her
With a strange infantine ingratitude
Shunn'd her as one indifferent. She was past
That anguish, for she felt her hour draw on,
And 'twas her only comfoft now to think
Upon the grave. 'Poor girl!' her mother said,
'Thou hast suffered much!' 'aye mother! there is none
'Can tell what I have suffered!' she replied,
'But I shall soon be where the weary rest.'
And she did rest her soon, for it pleased God
To take her to his mercy.
I thought if I took the flowers home
Flowers from a funeral
For a friend
A friend whose face
Looked unfamiliar
Unaware I was even there
Unsure if she'd really care
For cotton candy carnations
Lavender last goodbyes
A burly man carried
The carefully concocted
Cascades of colorful blooms
Close to the dumpster
The day after
He, disconnected from the despair
That dangled about my thoughts
But thought well enough
To stop long enough
To catch my stare
And spare the sprigs and sprays
Of fresh freesia
From the squashing stench
Of the sanitation truck's crunching
And handed them over to me
Like presenting a beauty queen
Her lavish winning bouquet
At home, with the  hum
Of a well working furnace
I put forth gallant  effort
Picking  purple plumes
From the florist's
Generic green foam
That held her final farewell
Gathered, I did in diligent work
Each vase from a collection of years
And brought to tears
Thinking if I watered them well
Placed beneath the light
Of my favorite window sill
Their fragrance to fill
My sadly lit room
Maybe, just maybe she'd stay
Awhile, share one more smile
Before being ready to say goodbye
Even the most beautiful bouquets
Wither wilt and die
I am standing at your funeral
Ready to say good bye
I am standing here
Ready to cry
Memories for me to recall
Of my first ball
Climbing tall  trees
Skined up knees
Swinging High
Touching the sky
When I returned
Your arms were there
Wraping me
With warmth comfort and care.
I am wondering why
This could'nt last?
Ending Days
Of my childhood past
Grave site train
Tears turn to  torrid rain
Good bye mother
There never will be another
Sadness is my care
My heart has a tear..
Outside waiting funeral hearse,
Taking from me, without coerce,
Your touch is far away
Angels guiding your way.
A day to say I am sorry
A day to say I love you
A day filled with unending feelings
A day filled with chocked emotions
Yielding myself to showers of tears
The shortness of life yields to death
Not allowing us to gauge every friendship
Not allowing us to give thanks for the memories
Giving us to retain
The Mythical
The magical
Thought of all this
But can I feel solemnity
A voice screams
Tribute Tribute
Inside of me
The screaming battles
With the burning devils from hell
Cannot be heard
Pacify me and cool my thoughts
With your comfort
The place where you will go
Absence of conflict and strife
The sun will shine again
Leaving behind the black and white
Vivid colors of an intangible arch
Stemming from the last down pour of tears
A distant rainbow belonging to you
Begging me to run through
Fickle threads catching
Raining colors of your love
From your absence
Voids, hollowness, and distressed wounds
Are being stitched shut
Smoothing healing balm
Covers like a blanket
Keeping you alive within me forever.
There was a dead bird on the grass,
Next to the sidewalk.
It's life had fled, somewhere up high,
Higher than it could ever have hoped to fly,
Into the infinite.
The twisted neck, the half shut eyes,
The wings outstretched,
As if, only, one final time,
They could lift him high and away,
From all Earthly dangers.
For some reason I envisioned,
In my minds eye,
The sweet little bird flying,
Headlong into the telephone wire,
Dying instantly, painlessly.
For other than the twisted neck,
There were no signs of violence,
On it's fragile avian body.
Only a few feathers,
Scattered ignominiously around.
Then a terrible, and inexplicable sadness,
Completely overwhelmed me.
And my body started to shake,
And from somewhere deep inside my soul my, very being,
A sob wrenched itself loose.
I could not in all honesty explain this.
Was it that I would never hear,
Him sing his songs?
Or dive bomb a cat,
While eying him meticulously from a limb.
Or was it just the obscene way,
That he was lying splayed on the grass.
Feathers all askew,
His toes curled up in the throes of death,
The neck twisted at an impossible angle.
But the merciful wind, in it's infinite wisdom,
Had blown a paper bag up against the fence.
This then, became the mockingbirds coffin.
And his funeral procession lead straight to my backyard.
As one last time, he visited his neighborhood.
There underneath a hackberry tree,
Filled with the berries,
That his folk love so much,
His broken little body nestled,
Into the welcoming arms of the Earth.
I would be a liar, if I said, I knew what made me,
Bring him home, to rest eternally, in the shade,
Of my hackberry tree.
But God knows, I was so happy and glad,
I could do that for him.
And today, after the passing of so many years,
There are many such trees,
All around my home.
And it seems that every single limb, is filled,
With carefree, sweet, singing mockingbirds.
2/4/12 Alton Texas
It's the one thing I can't rehearse
The final act where I have no lines
Or watch the audience in the isles
Complain of my performance in the role
And sneer derision that he looks so old
All powdered up and decked in mould
For one day they'll stand at their own curtains end
Being chewed by the flowers of their final applause
So long to the critics I can't hear you judge
Your despondent analysis of my really great lead
The only lead I ever had
In a role that I was born to play
In a role that I was born uncertain
Sitting there won't be so lonely
All cushioned up in velvet lining
Draped in mahogany chesterfield sachet
Escorted somewhere near the Hamptons
I'll be lead by strong men in maître d' form
Perhaps a young splendor will pass me a glance
While I'm indisposed to my own private table
Starring with thoughts that can't see conclusion
They'll be other occupants arranged in their seats
No one will see the others fatigue
Celebrating forever at our retire leisure
In a Funeral for one
And party that's just begun
Dust unto dust,
To this all must;
The tenant hath resign'd
The faded form To waste and worm-
Corruption claims her kind.
Through paths unknown
Thy soul hath flown,
To seek the realms of woe,
Where fiery pain
Shall purge the stain
Of actions done below.
In that sad place,
By Mary's grace,
Brief may thy dwelling be
Till prayers and alms,
And holy psalms,
Shall set the captive free.
march my soldiers march!
today is that day
feel like its you who died
for the best of us has left
march my soldiers march!
today is that day
when we pay for our silence
when we fail ourselves
march my soldiers march!
they strike us like dumb dogs
we are sitting ducks with a dead conscience
march my soldiers march!
we fall around like flies around fire
as we seek refuge in dark like alley rats
march my soldiers march!
with a single button finger they break our worlds
with a jihadi heart they spit blasphemous words
march my soldiers march!
see our brother's blood
is it redder than ours?
march my soldiers march!
don't you dare be sad
don't you dare cry
don't you dare forget
march my soldiers march!
today is that day
today our brother's soul rests in peace
today is the day we avenge our brothers
today is the day we make peace
today is the day we go to war

Processionals in the exemplary cave,
Benediction of shadows. Pomfret. London.
The voice fragrant with mannered humility,
With an equable contempt for this world,
‘In honorem Trinitatis’. Crash. The head
Struck down into a meaty conduit of blood.
So these dispose themselves to receive each
Pentecostal blow from axe or seraph,
Spattering block-straw with mortal residue.
Psalteries whine through the empyrean. Fire
Flares in the pit, ghosting upon stone
Creatures of such rampant state, vacuous
Ceremony of possession, restless
Habitation, no man’s dwelling-place.
2
For whom do we scrape our tribute of pain—
For none but the ritual king? We meditate
A rueful mystery; we are dying
To satisfy fat Caritas, those
Wiped jaws of stone. (Suppose all reconciled
By silent music; imagine the future
Flashed back at us, like steel against sun,
Ultimate recompense.) Recall the cold
Of Towton on Palm Sunday before dawn,
Wakefield, Tewkesbury: fastidious trumpets
Shrilling into the ruck; some trampled
Acres, parched, sodden or blanched by sleet,
Stuck with strange-postured dead. Recall the wind’s
Flurrying, darkness over the human mire.

They bespoke doomsday and they meant it by
God, their curved metal rimming the low ridge.
But few appearances are like this. Once
Every five hundred years a comet’s
Over-riding stillness might reveal men
In such array, livid and featureless,
With England crouched beastwise beneath it all.
‘Oh, that old northern business …’ A field
After battle utters its own sound
Which is like nothing on earth, but is earth.
Blindly the questing snail, vulnerable
Mole emerge, blindly we lie down, blindly
Among carnage the most delicate souls
Tup in their marriage-blood, gasping ‘Jesus’.
4
Let mind be more precious than soul; it will not
Endure. Soul grasps its price, begs its own peace,
Settles with tears and sweat, is possibly
Indestructible. That I can believe.
Though I would scorn the mere instinct of faith,
Expediency of assent, if I dared,
What I dare not is a waste history
Or void rule. Averroes, old heathen,
If only you had been right, if Intellect
Itself were absolute law, sufficient grace,
Our lives could be a myth of captivity
Which we might enter: an unpeopled region
Of ever new-fallen snow, a palace blazing
With perpetual silence as with torches.
5
As with torches we go, at wild Christmas,
When we revel in our atonement
Through thirty feasts of unction and slaughter,
What is that but the soul’s winter sleep?
So many things rest under consummate
Justice as though trumpets purified law,
Spikenard were the real essence of remorse.
The sky gathers up darkness. When we chant
‘Ora, ora pro nobis’ it is not
Seraphs who descend to pity but ourselves.
Those righteously-accused those vengeful
Racked on articulate looms indulge us
With lingering shows of pain, a flagrant
Tenderness of the damned for their own flesh:
6
My little son, when you could command marvels
Without mercy, outstare the wearisome
Dragon of sleep, I rejoiced above all—
A stranger well-received in your kingdom.
On those pristine fields I saw humankind
As it was named by the Father; fabulous
Beasts rearing in stillness to be blessed.
The world’s real cries reached there, turbulence
From remote storms, rumour of solitudes,
A composed mystery. And so it ends.
Some parch for what they were; others are made
Blind to all but one vision, their necessity
To be reconciled. I believe in my
Abandonment, since it is what I have.
7
‘Prowess, vanity, mutual regard,
It seemed I stared at them, they at me.
That was the gorgon’s true and mortal gaze:
Averted conscience turned against itself.’
A hawk and a hawk-shadow. ‘At noon,
As the armies met, each mirrored the other;
Neither was outshone. So they flashed and vanished
And all that survived them was the stark ground
Of this pain. I made no sound, but once
I stiffened as though a remote cry
Had heralded my name. It was nothing …’
Reddish ice tinged the reeds; dislodged, a few
Feathers drifted across; carrion birds
Strutted upon the armour of the dead.
8
Not as we are but as we must appear,
Contractual ghosts of pity; not as we
Desire life but as they would have us live,
Set apart in timeless colloquy.
So it is required; so we bear witness,
Despite ourselves, to what is beyond us,
Each distant sphere of harmony forever
Poised, unanswerable. If it is without
Consequence when we vaunt and suffer, or
If it is not, all echoes are the same
In such eternity. Then tell me, love,
How that should comfort us—or anyone
Dragged half-unnerved out of this worldly place,
Crying to the end ‘I have not finished’.
Three years ago, I passed a little church
While I walked on my way
Sorrow rang out from the steeple bells
As in the cemetery a group of people gathered
I stopped to watch for a moment
A small coffin being carried to the graveside
Where soon it would be laid
The priest stood beside it and slowly said
“The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
We commit this child into the arms of the Lord
For his safe keeping for ever and ever
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.”
At the graveside I could see in the scene
A young girl about nineteen and young man about twenty one
Both were heartbroken because it was their child
Their one any only son
Being laid to rest, but never to be forgotten
I turned to go on my way, when I saw from the grave
A stairway to the sky appear
On each step an angel stood all looking young and fair
I stood astonished for a while
As up the stairs walked a child
From that day to this I wonder all the time
What was the meaning of this sign
(Date written unknown)
I saw a long funeral
a dead ant being carried
in a long queue.
It was quite placable
some were exchanging shoulder
It was the last moment
to pay homage to the departed soul
I  too prayed for the departed soul
Rest in peace!

Sadness falls as a meteor
Dry the last drop of tear
Desperation, the iron chains
To tie everyone's throat deadly
Brief tortures brief
There is no place for salvation
On the land abandoned by God
In the East, in the East -
Before A hundred years ago
The wind blows the horn
The crow encourages us to commit suicide
Tortoise tries to wake the land up
He is too slow, too slow-
To find the ear of land
Flood water is coming!
Coming from east of the east
Judgment-Day, isn’t it?
To foretell the future
To wait for angry of God
To trouble in huge seas
Now, everyone on this land
Pick up the shovel
Get ready to bury, bury this century
Digging out the truth and false
Never stop! Until we bury ourselves
when the blood is flying in the night
Twinkled is nothing but eye of Satan
Drizzle, Drizzle-
Moisten the thirsty throat selflessly
And expand them inside the chains
Flower breaks off blooming
Grass are ready to be trampled
The sea carries floor water-
In silent tribute with anger and killing
Fly in the sky
Float down the wave
Fell into the ground
A red night, A red night
Funeral Of Century（2）
LOL. I hope my english will be better than in (1) .
East coast, Tsunami rushed like wolves
Cloudburst was the flag, then
here the ceremony of funeral started
Holy water to wash all sin was the flood
To clean the evil in past
and share the guitly in future
Righteous were willing to die for salvation
but the Lord lost his patience
Curse falled down with rain to the world
Ancient Civilization, To be buryed or submerged
To be baptized the world
Cry and cry, scream again scream
No Noah's Ark to be found
East coast, people still intoxicated
Resentment, To feed the demon stronger
The ghostes drunk like a fish
with the heavy punch smashed they run away
Puppets still not noticed the dangerous
Condor wheeled in the air above the upcoming food
Shrug, dreariness as well as dismal
The magic song flew from faraway -
for last time of the earth
for last time of the day
Ancient Civilization, To be buryed or submerged
To be baptized the world
Cry and cry, scream again scream
No Noah's Ark to be found
The day that YOUTH had died,
There came to his grave-side,
In decent mourning, from the country's ends,
Those scatter'd friends
Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,
The days and nights and dawnings of the time
When YOUTH kept open house,
Nor left untasted
Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,
No quest of his unshar'd --
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,
Followed their old friend's bier.
FOLLY went first,
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd;
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand --
LAUGHTER, most hoarse, and Captain PRIDE with tanned
And martial face all grim, and fussy JOY,
Who had to catch a train, and LUST, poor, snivelling boy;
These bore the dear departed.
Behind them, broken-hearted,
Came GRIEF, so noisy a widow, that all said,
"Had he but wed
Her elder sister SORROW, in her stead!"
And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,
The fatherless children, COLOUR, TUNE, and RHYME
(The sweet lad RHYME), ran all-uncomprehending.
Then, at the way's sad ending,
Round the raw grave they stay'd.  Old WISDOM read,
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.
There stood ROMANCE,
The furrowing tears had mark'd her rouged cheek;
Poor old CONCEIT, his wonder unassuaged;
Dead INNOCENCY's daughter, IGNORANCE;
And shabby, ill-dress'd GENEROSITY;
And ARGUMENT, too full of woe to speak;
PASSION, grown portly, something middle-aged;
And FRIENDSHIP -- not a minute older, she;
IMPATIENCE, ever taking out his watch;
FAITH, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch
Old WISDOM's endless drone.
BEAUTY was there,
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
Poor maz'd IMAGINATION; FANCY wild;
ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair;
CONTENTMENT, who had known YOUTH as a child
And never seen him since.  And SPRING came too,
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers --
She did not stay for long.
And TRUTH, and GRACE, and all the merry crew,
The laughing WINDS and RIVERS, and lithe HOURS;
And HOPE, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing SONG; --
Yes, with much woe and mourning general,
At dead YOUTH's funeral,
Even these were met once more together, all,
Who erst the fair and living YOUTH did know;
All, except only LOVE.  LOVE had died long ago.
The death, end of the life journey
But not the end itself
The joining of self to the universe
The place of oblivion we can't explain.
The body after death, a corpse
To be cremated in such an honor
The self, soul and their activities
For which the body functioned hitherto.
A funeral pyre we makes
For its destruction on bodily matters
The final destiny it follows
Where it becomes flames and ashes.
Funeral in varied customs and beliefs
Changes of methods and things are one
The final journey must be in calm
without a return and repetition of the same.
Honor the death, the will of god
Your actions and life events are reckoned
And matters to the humans
Let the final journey come when it destines.
In a calm and perfect time like a ripe leaf.
.
It was first experience
I had to attend funeral procession at once
Someone had died due to heart attack
Entire road leading to crematorium was packed
“If you do not attend” father snarled
None would sent
Their family members
As dead body carriers
It is tradition for all relatives and friend
To carry dead body one by one till end
Lay body on cremation ground
Large numbers of people are always found
The body is put on funeral pyre
Given ignition to fire woods
The body catches fire in no time
It is reduced to ashes with little time
I was young and student
I had never been present in such procession
I though” what an end to final journey”
When we are carried away back to an almighty
men in black,
women also.
I've seen them a couple of times
since I was a kid,
and some more
till I die.
I want to have my funeral
But first I need to die
But not an ordinary death
You see
I want one filled of surprise
One death that no one would expect
One that’ll beat the rest
Of the
Out of the ordinary deaths
A death that will show the pain I hide
One that will make people tremble inside
To see that a little girl could hide
So much trouble and hate inside her mind
One that’ll have me on a bed
With rose petals all around my head
My wrist all cut up at the vein
A death that’ll make me look insane
It’ll have them saying
“maybe she hit her head”
For the death expressed too much
And set a feeling of depressed
Maybe a death
That’ll have written on my chest
All the things that “you knew best”
All the things I failed to see
Because they never were facing me
A death is called a tragedy
But not when nobody can see
That the tragedy was meant to be
Like the sun is meant to set each day
And how the moon never seems to stay
So tonight I will toast at your funeral.
Because we knew this wouldn’t end well.
Lately I’ve began to look and see.
That we are lost in our own history.
Times will change and lives will spend
Harvests will come and wounds shall mend
Hearts will blaze with the past no more,
We’ll seek the future, but it wont come
I ask for peace yet receive none,
And now the present has come undone
Now time has shown itself to be a demon that’s cursed
And yet we know that we still haven’t seen the worst.
I walked along and couldn’t tell
That my sorrow dies with every word.
Truthfully is say no more, and with a smile I toast….at your funeral.

You told me the song to play at your funeral
As if I can think that far ahead
I haven't even held your hand
or kissed your face
ran my fingers through your hair
or trailed them down your chest
i've never looked in your eyes
and told you that i love you
your touch I've never felt
nor the warmth of your body on mine
But you told me the song to play at your funeral
A grand assumption don't you think
Around Sebago's lonely lake
There lingers not a breeze to break
The mirror which its waters make.
The solemn pines along its shore,
The firs which hang its gray rocks o'er,
Are painted on its glassy floor.
The sun looks o'er, with hazy eye,
The snowy mountain-tops which lie
Piled coldly up against the sky.
Dazzling and white! save where the bleak,
Wild winds have bared some splintering peak,
Or snow-slide left its dusky streak.
Yet green are Saco's banks below,
And belts of spruce and cedar show,
Dark fringing round those cones of snow.
The earth hath felt the breath of spring,
Though yet on her deliverer's wing
The lingering frosts of winter cling.
Fresh grasses fringe the meadow-brooks,
And mildly from its sunny nooks
The blue eye of the violet looks.
And odors from the springing grass,
The sweet birch and the sassafras,
Upon the scarce-felt breezes pass.
Her tokens of renewing care
Hath Nature scattered everywhere,
In bud and flower, and warmer air.
But in their hour of bitterness,
What reek the broken Sokokis,
Beside their slaughtered chief, of this?
The turf's red stain is yet undried,
Scarce have the death-shot echoes died
Along Sebago's wooded side;
And silent now the hunters stand,
Grouped darkly, where a swell of land
Slopes upward from the lake's white sand.
Fire and the axe have swept it bare,
Save one lone beech, unclosing there
Its light leaves in the vernal air.
With grave, cold looks, all sternly mute,
They break the damp turf at its foot,
And bare its coiled and twisted root.
They heave the stubborn trunk aside,
The firm roots from the earth divide,--
The rent beneath yawns dark and wide.
And there the fallen chief is laid,
In tasselled garb of skins arrayed,
And girded with his wampum-braid.
The silver cross he loved is pressed
Beneath the heavy arms, which rest
Upon his scarred and naked breast.
'T is done: the roots are backward sent,
The beechen-tree stands up unbent,
The Indian's fitting monument!
When of that sleeper's broken race
Their green and pleasant dwelling-place,
Which knew them once, retains no trace;
Oh, long may sunset's light be shed
As now upon that beech's head,
A green memorial of the dead!
There shall his fitting requiem be,
In northern winds, that, cold and free,
Howl nightly in that funeral tree.
To their wild wail the waves which break
Forever round that lonely lake
A solemn undertone shall make!
And who shall deem the spot unblest,
Where Nature's younger children rest,
Lulled on their sorrowing mother's breast?
Deem ye that mother loveth less
These bronzed forms of the wilderness
She foldeth in her long caress?
As sweet o'er them her wild-flowers blow,
As if with fairer hair and brow
The blue-eyed Saxon slept below.
What though the places of their rest
No priestly knee hath ever pressed,--
No funeral rite nor prayer hath blessed?
What though the bigot's ban be there,
And thoughts of wailing and despair,
And cursing in the place of prayer.
Yet Heaven hath angels watching round
The Indian's lowliest forest-mound,--
And they have made it holy ground.
There ceases man's frail judgment; all
His powerless bolts of cursing fall
Unheeded on that grassy pall.
O peeled and hunted and reviled,
Sleep on, dark tenant of the wild!
Great Nature owns her simple child!
And Nature's God, to whom alone
The secret of the heart is known,--
The hidden language traced thereon;
Who from its many cumberings
Of form and creed, and outward things,
To light the naked spirit brings;
Not with our partial eye shall scan,
Not with our pride and scorn shall ban,
The spirit of our brother man!
I attended mass at church this morning
This was a funeral mass for Mr Jim.
He was blessed with excellent longevity.
Joining him at church were his wife,
his grand children and great grandchildren.
They bid him farewell for his journey to heaven.
He was cremated and he became ashes.
He didn't need time for his body to decay.
Funeral van didn't carry his coffin
All of his remain was contained in a little urn.
After being buried in the cemetery by his family
All that was left of him are his ashes in his urn.

I
I saw a slowly-stepping train --
Lined on the brows, scoop-eyed and bent and hoar --
Following in files across a twilit plain
A strange and mystic form the foremost bore.
II
And by contagious throbs of thought
Or latent knowledge that within me lay
And had already stirred me, I was wrought
To consciousness of sorrow even as they.
III
The fore-borne shape, to my blurred eyes,
At first seemed man-like, and anon to change
To an amorphous cloud of marvellous size,
At times endowed with wings of glorious range.
IV
And this phantasmal variousness
Ever possessed it as they drew along:
Yet throughout all it symboled none the less
Potency vast and loving-kindness strong.
V
Almost before I knew I bent
Towards the moving columns without a word;
They, growing in bulk and numbers as they went,
Struck out sick thoughts that could be overheard: --
VI
'O man-projected Figure, of late
Imaged as we, thy knell who shall survive?
Whence came it we were tempted to create
One whom we can no longer keep alive?
VII
'Framing him jealous, fierce, at first,
We gave him justice as the ages rolled,
Will to bless those by circumstance accurst,
And longsuffering, and mercies manifold.
VIII
'And, tricked by our own early dream
And need of solace, we grew self-deceived,
Our making soon our maker did we deem,
And what we had imagined we believed,
IX
'Till, in Time's stayless stealthy swing,
Uncompromising rude reality
Mangled the Monarch of our fashioning,
Who quavered, sank; and now has ceased to be.
X
'So, toward our myth's oblivion,
Darkling, and languid-lipped, we creep and grope
Sadlier than those who wept in Babylon,
Whose Zion was a still abiding hope.
XI
'How sweet it was in years far hied
To start the wheels of day with trustful prayer,
To lie down liegely at the eventide
And feel a blest assurance he was there!
XII
'And who or what shall fill his place?
Whither will wanderers turn distracted eyes
For some fixed star to stimulate their pace
Towards the goal of their enterprise?'...
XIII
Some in the background then I saw,
Sweet women, youths, men, all incredulous,
Who chimed as one: 'This is figure is of straw,
This requiem mockery! Still he lives to us!'
XIV
I could not prop their faith: and yet
Many I had known: with all I sympathized;
And though struck speechless, I did not forget
That what was mourned for, I, too, once had prized.
XV
Still, how to bear such loss I deemed
The insistent question for each animate mind,
And gazing, to my growing sight there seemed
A pale yet positive gleam low down behind,
XVI
Whereof, to lift the general night,
A certain few who stood aloof had said,
'See you upon the horizon that small light --
Swelling somewhat?' Each mourner shook his head.
XVII
And they composed a crowd of whom
Some were right good, and many nigh the best....
Thus dazed and puzzled 'twixt the gleam and gloom
Mechanically I followed with the rest.
A WAIL was heard around the bed, the death-bed of the young,
Amidst her tears the Funeral Chant a mournful mother sung.
-'Ianthis! dost thou sleep?-Thou sleep'st!-but this is not the rest,
The breathing and the rosy calm, I have pillow'd on my breast!
I lull'd thee not to this repose, Ianthis! my sweet son!
As in thy glowing childhood's time by twilight I have done!
-How is it that I bear to stand and look upon thee now?
And that I die not, seeing death on thy pale glorious brow?
'I look upon thee, thou that wert of all most fair and brave!
I see thee wearing still too much of beauty for the grave!
Though mournfully thy smile is fix'd, and heavily thine eye
Hath shut above the falcon-glance that in it lov'd to lie;
And fast is bound the springing step, that seem'd on breezes borne,
When to thy couch I came and said,-'Wake, hunter, wake! 'tis morn!'
Yet art thou lovely still, my flower! untouch'd by slow decay,
-And I, the wither'd stem remain-I would that grief might slay!
'Oh! ever when I met thy look, I knew that this would be!
I knew too well that length of days was not a gift for thee!
I saw it in thy kindling cheek, and in thy bearing high;-
A voice came whispering to my soul, and told me thou must die!
That thou must die, my fearless one! where swords were flashing red.-
-Why doth a mother live to say-my first-born and my dead?
They tell me of thy youthful fame, they talk of victory won-
-Speak thou, and I will hear! my child, Ianthis! my sweet son!'
A wail was heard around the bed, the deathbed of the young,
A fair-hair'd bride the Funeral Chant amidst her weeping sung.
-'Ianthis! look'st thou not on me? -Can love indeed be fled?
When was it woe before to gaze upon thy stately head?
I would that I had follow'd thee, Ianthis, my belov'd!
And stood as woman oft hath stood where faithful hearts are prov'd!
That I had bound a breastplate on, and battled at thy side-
-It would have been a blessed thing together had we died!
'But where was I when thou didst fall beneath the fatal sword?
Was I beside the sparkling fount, or at the peaceful board?
Or singing some sweet song of old, in the shadow of the vine,
Or praying to the saints for thee, before the holy shrine?
And thou wert lying low the while, the life-drops from thy heart
Fast gushing like a mountain-spring!-and couldst thou thus depart?
Couldst thou depart, nor on my lips pour out thy fleeting breath?
-Oh! I was with thee but in joy, that should have been in death!
'Yes! I was with thee when the dance through mazy rings was led,
And when the lyre and voice were tun'd, and when the feast was spread;
But not where noble blood flow'd forth, where sounding javelins flew-
-Why did I hear love's first sweet words, and not its last adieu?
What now can breathe of gladness more, what scene, what hour, what tone?
The blue skies fade with all their lights, they fade, since thou art gone!
Ev'n that must leave me, that still face, by all my tears unmov'd-
-Take me from this dark world with thee, Ianthis! my belov'd!'
A wail was heard around the bed, the death-bed of the young,
Amidst her tears the Funeral Chant a mournful sister sung.
'Ianthis! brother of my soul!-oh! where are now the days
That laugh'd among the deep green hills, on all our infant plays?
When we two sported by the streams, or track'd them to their source,
And like a stag's, the rocks along, was thy fleet fearless course!
-I see the pines there waving yet, I see the rills descend,
I see thy bounding step no more-my brother and my friend!
'I come with flowers-for spring is come!-Ianthis! art thou here?
I bring the garlands she hath brought, I cast them on thy bier!
Thou shouldst be crown'd with victory's crown-but oh! more meet they seem,
The first faint violets of the wood, and lilies of the stream!
More meet for one so fondly lov'd, and laid thus early low-
-Alas! how sadly sleeps thy face amidst the sunshine's glow:
The golden glow that through thy heart was wont such joy to send,
-Woe, that it smiles, and not for thee!-my brother and my friend!'
Bright day of autumn, springing
Morning dews thin out, how pleasant it
Is to make last journey…….
APRIL 29, 1874
SUNG BY MALE VOICES TO A NATIONAL AIR OF HOLLAND
ONCE more, ye sacred towers,
Your solemn dirges sound;
Strew, loving hands, the April flowers,
Once more to deck his mound.
A nation mourns its dead,
Its sorrowing voices one,
As Israel's monarch bowed his head
And cried, 'My son! My son!'
Why mourn for him?--For him
The welcome angel came
Ere yet his eye with age was dim
Or bent his stately frame;
His weapon still was bright,
His shield was lifted high
To slay the wrong, to save the right,--
What happier hour to die?
Thou orderest all things well;
Thy servant's work was done;
He lived to hear Oppression's knell,
The shouts for Freedom won.
Hark!! from the opening skies
The anthem's echoing swell,--
'O mourning Land, lift up thine eyes!
God reigneth. All is well!'
I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading--treading--till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through--
And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum--
Kept beating--beating--till I thought
My Mind was going numb--
And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space--began to toll,
As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race
Wrecked, solitary, here--
And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down--
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing--then--
Eighty years of life
on this Earth
Was it worth?
I had a thought on your funeral.
Eighty years ago in heaven
when you were just the soul
and wanted to forever become
a part of this whole
You urged God to grant you a life
And promised
you would this time achieve your goal
But did you keep your promise at all?
I had a thought on your funeral.
The aim of your taking birth was
Service, contribution and asceticism
You instead chose
Hoarding, platitude and hedonism
God prescribed
Love, joy and compassion
On your life you inscribed
Jealousy, gloom and repression
I had a thought on your funeral.
Childhood’s dawn wiped out in dependence
Lust devoured on the morning of adolescence
Youth’s noon you squandered
due to fear and apprehension
Dusk of old age got totaled in
egotism, vanity and pretension
I had a thought on your funeral.
I asked myself
Was I any different from you?
Was I keeping my own promise to God?
The response from within came in negative
My heart did not give the nod
Seeing you sleeping in God’s lap
with a performance that was dismal
Your funeral appeared to me
as God’s signal
And I realized I had a chance to change
before I reached my own burial.
I had a thought on your funeral.
(30.08.2011; New Delhi; India)
Lilacs at my funeral
Lilacs when I’m dead
Lilacs in my coffin
Placed gently by my head
Lilacs at my funeral
Lilacs when I’m gone
Lilacs to help send me
On my journey home
Lilacs at my funeral
Lilacs for my grave
Lilacs instead of roses
Think of the money you will save

And now the bell, - the bell
She had so often heard by night and day
And listened to with solemn pleasure,
E'en as a living voice, -
Rung its remorseless toll for her,
So young, so beautiful, so good.
Decrepit age, and vigorous life,
And blooming youth, and helpless infancy,
Poured forth, - on crutches, in the pride of strength
And health, in the full blush
Of promise, the mere dawn of life, -
To gather round her tomb. Old men were there,
Whose eyes were dim
And senses failing, -
Grandames, who might have died ten years ago,
And still been old, - the deaf, the blind, the lame,
The palsied,
The living dead in many shapes and forms,
To see the closing of this early grave.
What was the death it would shut in,
To that which still could crawl and keep above it!
Along the crowded path they bore her now;
Pure as the new fallen snow
That covered it; whose day on earth
Had been as fleeting.
Under that porch, where she had sat when Heaven
In mercy brought her to that peaceful spot,
She passed again, and the old church
Received her in its quiet shade.
They carried her to one old nook,
Where she had many and many a time sat musing,
And laid their burden softly on the pavement.
The light streamed on it through
The colored window, - a window where the boughs
Of trees were ever rustling
In the summer, and where the birds
Sang sweetly all day long.
The death of Duryodhan concludes the war, and it is followed by
the lament of women and the funerals of the deceased warriors.
I
Kuru Women visit the Battle-field
Spake the ancient Dhrita-rashtra, father of a hundred sons,
Sonless now and sorrow-stricken, dark his ebbing life-tide runs!
'Gods fulfil my life's last wishes! Henchmen, yoke my royal car,
Dhrita-rashtra meets his princes in the silent field of war,
Speed unto the Queen Gandhari, to the dames of Kuru's house,
To each dear departed warrior wends his fair and faithful spouse!'
Queen Gandhari sorrow-laden with the ancient Pritha came,
And each weeping widowed princess and each wailing childless dame,
And they saw the hoary monarch, father of a perished race,
Fresh and loud awoke their sorrow, welling tears suffused their face,
Good Vidura ever gentle whispered comfort unto all,
Placed the dames within their chariots, left Hastina's palace hall!
Loud the wail of woe and sorrow rose from every Kuru house,
Children wept beside their mothers for each widowed royal spouse,
Veiled dwellers of the palace, scarce the gods their face had seen,
Heedless now through mart and city sped each widowed childless queen,
From their royal brow and bosom gem and jewel cast aside,
Loose their robes and loose their tresses, quenched their haughty queenly
pride!
So when falls the antlered monarch, struck by woe and sudden fear
Issuing from their snowy mountains listless stray the dappled deer,
So upon the broad arena milk-white fillies brave the sun,
Wildly toss their flowing tresses and in sad disorder run!
Clinging to her weeping sister wept each dame in cureless pain,
For the lord, the son or father in the deathful battle slain,
Wept and smote her throbbing bosom and in bitter anguish wailed,
Till her senses reeled in sorrow, till her woman's reason failed!
Veiled queens and bashful maidens, erst they shunned the public eye,
Blush nor shame suffused their faces as they passed the city by,
Gentle-bosomed, kindly hearted, erst they wiped each other's eye,
Now by common sorrow laden none for sister heaved a sigh!
With this troop of wailing women, deep in woe, disconsolate,
Slow the monarch of the Kurus passed Hastina's outer gate,
Men from stall and loom and anvil, men of every guild and trade,
Left the city with the monarch, through the open country strayed,
And a universal sorrow filled the air and answering sky,
As when ends the mortal's _Yuga_ and the end of world is nigh!
II
Gandhari's Lament for the Slain
Stainless Queen and stainless woman, ever righteous ever good,
Stately in her mighty sorrow on the field Gandhari stood!
Strewn with skulls and clotted tresses, darkened by the stream of gore,
With the limbs of countless warriors was the red field covered o'er,
Elephants and steeds of battle, car-borne chiefs untimely slain,
Headless trunks and heads dissevered fill the red and ghastly plain!
And the long-drawn howl of jackals o'er the scene of carnage rings,
And the vulture and the raven flap their dark and loathsome wings,
Feasting on the blood of warriors foul _pisachas_ fill the air,
Viewless forms of hungry _rakshas_ limb from limb the corpses tear!
Through this scene of death and carnage was the ancient monarch led,
Kuru dames with faltering footsteps stepped amidst the countless dead,
And a piercing wail of anguish burst upon the echoing plain,
As they saw their sons or fathers, brothers, lords, amidst the slain,
As they saw the wolves of jungle feed upon the destined prey,
Darksome wanderers of the midnight prowling in the light of day!
Shriek of pain and wail of anguish o'er the ghastly field resound,
And their feeble footsteps falter and they sink upon the ground,
Sense and life desert the mourners as they faint in common grief,
Death-like swoon succeeding sorrow yields a moment's short relief!
Then a mighty sigh of anguish from Gandhari's bosom broke,
Gazing on her anguished daughters unto Krishna thus she spoke:
'Mark my unconsoled daughters, widowed queens of Kuru's house,
Wailing for their dear departed, like the osprey for her spouse!
How each cold and fading feature wakes in them a woman's love,
How amidst the lifeless warriors still with restless steps they rove,
Mothers hug their slaughtered children all unconscious in their sleep,
Widows bend upon their husbands and in ceaseless sorrow weep!
Mighty Bhishma, hath he fallen? quenched is archer Karna's pride?
Drupad monarch of Panchala sleeps by foeman Drona's side?
Shining mail and costly jewels, royal bangles strew the plain,
Golden garlands rich and burnished deck the chiefs untimely slain,
Lances hurled by stalwart fighters, clubs of mighty wrestlers killed,
Swords and bows of ample measure, quivers still with arrows filled!
Mark the unforgotten heroes, jungle prowlers 'mid them stray,
On their brow and mailed bosoms heedless perch the birds of prey!
Mark they great unconquered heroes famed on earth from west to east,
_Kankas_ perch upon their foreheads, hungry wolves upon them feast!
Mark the kings, on softest cushion scarce the needed rest they found,
Now they lie in peaceful slumber on the hard and reddened ground!
Mark the youths who morn and evening listed to the minstrel's song,
In their ear the loathsome jackal doth his doleful wail prolong!
See the chieftains with their maces and their swords of trusty steel,
Still they grasp their tried weapons,--do they still the life-pulse feel?'
III
Gandhari's Lament for Duryodhan
Thus to Krishna, Queen Gandhari strove her woeful thoughts to tell,
When alas! her wandering vision on her son Duryodhan fell,
Sudden anguish smote her bosom and her senses seemed to stray,
Like a tree by tempest shaken senseless on the earth she lay!
Once again she waked in sorrow, once again she cast her eye
Where her son in blood empurpled slept beneath the open sky,
And she clasped her dear Duryodhan, held him close unto her breast,
Sobs convulsive shook her bosom as the lifeless form she prest,
And her tears like rains of summer fell and washed his noble head,
Decked with garlands still untarnished, graced with _nishkas_ bright
and red!
''Mother!' said my dear Duryodhan when he went unto the war,
'Wish me joy and wish me triumph as I mount the battle-car!'
'Son!' I said to dear Duryodhan, 'Heaven avert a cruel fate,
_Yato dharma stato jayah!_ Triumph doth on Virtue wait!'
But he set his heart on battle, by his valour wiped his sins,
Now he dwells in realms celestial which the faithful warrior wins!
And I weep not for Duryodhan, like a prince he fought and fell,
But my sorrow-stricken husband, who can his misfortunes tell?
Ay! my son was brave and princely, all resistless in the war,
Now he sleeps the sleep of warriors, sunk in gloom his glorious star!
Ay! My son mid crowned monarchs held the first and foremost way,
Now he rests upon the red earth, quenched his bright effulgent ray!
Ay! my son the best of heroes, he hath won the warrior's sky,
Kshatras nobly conquer, Krishna, when in war they nobly die!
Hark the loathsome cry of jackals, how the wolves their vigils keep,
Maidens rich in song and beauty erst were wont to watch his sleep!
Hark the foul and blood-beaked vultures flap their wings upon the dead,
Maidens waved their feathery _pankhas_ round Duryodhan's royal bed!
Peerless bowman, mighty monarch! nations still his hests obeyed,
As a lion slays a tiger, Bhima hath Duryodhan slayed!
Thirteen years o'er Kuru's empire proud Duryodhan held his sway,
Ruled Hastina's ancient city where fair Ganga's waters stray!
I have seen his regal splendour with these ancient eyes of mine,
Elephants and battle-chariots, steeds of war and herds of kine!
Kuru owns another master and Duryodhan's day is fled,
And I live to be a witness! Krishna, O that I were dead!
Mark Duryodhan's noble widow, mother proud of Lakshman bold,
Queenly in her youth and beauty, like an altar of bright gold!
Torn from husband's sweet embraces, from her son's entwining arms,
Doomed to life-long woe and anguish in her youth and in her charms!
Rend my hard and stony bosom crushed beneath this cruel pain,
Should Gandhari live to witness noble son and grandson slain?
Mark again Duryodhan's widow, how she hugs his gory head,
How with gentle hands and tender softly holds him on his bed!
How from dear departed husband turns she to her dearer son,
And the tear-drops of the mother choke the widow's bitter groan!
Like the fibre of the lotus tender-golden is her frame,
O my lotus! O my daughter! Bharat's pride and Kuru's fame!
If the truth resides in _Vedas_, brave Duryodhan dwells above,
Wherefore linger we in sadness severed from his cherished love?
If the truth resides in _Sastra_, dwells in sky my hero son,
For Gandhari and her daughter now their earthly task is done!'
IV
Funeral Rite
Victor of a deathful battle, sad Yudhishthir viewed the plain,
Friends and kinsmen, kings and chieftains, countless troops untimely slain,
And he spake to wise Sudharman, pious priest of Kuru's race,
Unto Sanjay, unto Dhaumya, to Vidura full of grace,
Spake unto the brave Yuyutsu, Kuru's last surviving chief,
Spake to faithful Indrasena, and to warriors sunk in grief:
'Pious rites are due to foemen and to friends and kinsmen slain,
None shall lack a fitting funeral, none shall perish on the plain.'
Wise Vidura and his comrades sped on sacred duty bound,
Sandalwood and scented aloes, oil and _ghee_ and perfumes found,
Silken robes of costly splendour, fabrics by the artist wove,
Dry wood from the thorny jungle, perfume from the scented grove,
Shattered cars and splintered lances, hewed and ready for the fire,
Piled and ranged in perfect order into many a funeral pyre.
Kings and princes, noble warriors, were in rank and order laid,
And with streams of melted butter were the rich libations made,
Blazed the fire with wondrous radiance by the rich libations fed,
Sanctifying and consuming mortal remnants of the dead.
Brave Duryodhan and his brothers, Salya of the mighty car,
Bhurisravas king of nations, Jayadratha famed in war,
Abhimanyu son of Arjun, Lakshman proud Duryodhan's son,
Somadatta and the Srinjays famed for deeds of valour done,
Matsya's monarch proud Virata, Drupad fair Panchala's king,
And his sons, Panchala's princes, whose great deeds the minstrels sing,
Cultured monarch of Kosala and Gandhara's wily lord,
Karna, proud and peerless archer, matchless with his flaming sword,
Bhagadatta eastern monarch, all resistless in his car,
Ghatotkacha son of Bhima, Alambusha famed in war,
And a hundred other monarchs all received the pious rite,
Till the radiance of the fire-light chased the shadows of the night!
_Pitri-medha_, due to fathers, was performed with pious care,
Hymns and wails and lamentations mingled in the midnight air,
Sacred songs of _rik_ and _saman_ rose with women's piercing wail,
And the creatures of the wide earth heard the sound subdued and pale!
Smokeless and with radiant lustre shone each red and lighted pyre,
Like the planets of the bright sky throbbing with celestial fire!
Countless myriads, nameless, friendless, from each court and camp afar,
From the east and west collected, fell in Kuru-Kshetra's war,
Thousand fires for them were lighted, they received the pious rite,
Such was good Yudhishthir's mandate, such was wise Vidura's might,
All the dead were burned to ashes and the sacred rite was o'er,
Dhrita-rashtra and Yudhishthir slowly walked to Ganga's shore!
V
Oblation to Karna
Sacred Ganga, ample-bosomed, sweeps along in regal pride,
Rolling down her limpid waters through high banks on either side,
Kuru dames and weeping widows thither in their anguish came
Due and holy rites to render to departed chiefs of fame,
Casting forth their jewelled girdles, gems and scarfs belaced with gold,
Gave oblations of the water to each hero true and bold,
Unto fathers, unto husbands, unto sons in battle slayed,
Offerings of the sacred water sorrowing wives and mothers made.
And so great the host of mourners wending to perform the rite,
That their footsteps made a pathway in the sad and sacred site,
And the shelving banks of Ganga peopled by the sorrowing train,
Wide-expanding, vast and sealike, formed a scene of woe and pain!
But a wave of keener sorrow swept o'er Pritha's heaving breast,
As unto her weeping children thus her secret she expressed:
_'He, my sons, the peerless bowman, mighty in his battle-car,
He who bore the stamp of hero, slain by Arjun in the war,_
_He whom as the son of Radha, chariot-driver, ye have thought,
He who shone with SURYA'S lustre as his countless foes he fought,_
_He who faced your stoutest warriors and in battle never failed,
He who led the Kuru forces and in danger never quailed,_
_He who knew no peer in prowess, owned in war no haughtier name,
He who yielded life, not honour, and by death hath conquered fame,_
_He, in truth who never faltered, never left his vow undone,
Offer unto him oblation, Karna was my eldest son!_
_Karna was your honoured elder, and the Sun inspired his birth,
Karna in his rings and armour Sun-like trod the spacious earth!'_
Pritha spake, and terror-stricken Pandav brothers groaned in pain,
And they wept in woe and anguish for the brother they had slain.
Hissing forth his sigh of sorrow like a trodden, hissing snake,
Sad Yudhishthir to his mother thus his inward feelings spake:
'Didst thou, mother, bear the hero fathomless like ocean dread,
Whose unfailing glistening arrows like its countless billows sped?
Didst thou bear that peerless archer, all-resistless in his car,
Sweeping with the roar of ocean through the shattered ranks of war?
Didst thou bear the mighty hero, mortal man of heavenly birth,
Crushing 'neath his arm of valour all his foemen on the earth?
Didst thou hide the birth and lineage of that chief of deathful ire,
As a man in folds of garments seeks to hide the flaming fire?
Arjun, wielder of _gandiva_, was for us no truer stay
Than was Karna for the Kurus in the battle's dread array!
Monarchs matched not Karna's glory nor his deeds of valour done,
Midst the mighty car-borne warriors mightiest warrior Karna shone!
Was he then our eldest brother we have in the battle slain,
And our nearest dearest elder fell upon the gory plain?
Not the death of Abhimanyu from the fair Subhadra torn,
Not the slaughter of the princes by the proud Draupadi borne,
Not the fall of Kuru warriors, nor Panchala's mighty host,
Like thy death afflicts my bosom, noble Karna! loved and lost!
Monarch's empire, victor's glory, all the treasures earth can yield,
Righteous bliss and heavenly gladness, harvest of the _swarga's_ field,
All that wish can shape and utter, all that nourish hope and pride,
All were ours, O noble Karna! with thee by thy brother's side,
And this carnage of the Kurus these sad eyes had never seen,
Peace had graced our blessed empire, happy would the earth have been!'
Long bewailed the sad Yudhishthir for his elder loved and dead,
And oblation of the water to the noble Karna made,
And the royal dames of Kuru viewed the sight with freshening pain,
Wept to see the good Yudhishthir offering to his brother slain,
And the widowed queen of Karna with the women of his house
Gave oblations to her hero, wept her loved and slaughtered spouse!
Done the rites to the departed, done oblations to the dead,
Slowly then the sad survivors on the river's margin spread,
Far along the shore and sandbank of the sacred sealike stream
Maid and matron laved their bodies 'neath the morning's holy beam,
And ablutions done, the Kurus slow and sad and cheerless part,
Wend their way to far Hastina with a void and vacant heart.
It has been fun,
she says at last.
Pure shock spreads
quickly 'cross her face,
from ear to ear.
Yes, fifty years it's been
and time enough
for shreds of hatred
to   mature
into indifference.
And now she finds herself
at the well-rusted iron portal
of her familiar God's Green Acres
to say one last farewell,
with just one whisper
of a fleeting thought
'bygone it be.'
When unknown arms
of roughness
turn her away.
And from the depth of
one new grave
a melody is heard.
It is the taunting sound of
scornful laughter.
My Funeral Pen writes for me
All of these words that set me free
The pen that I shared for  Mourners to sign
The pen that I wrote to turn back time
The pen that I wrote the Funeral Plans
While Families cried I held their hands
This pen has been held ever so tight
By many seeing darkness yet others seeing light
This pen holds memories dear to my heart
Bringing togetherness
Yet Families torn apart

Darkness encompasses my space
My future seen bleak, feral beasts hide
Not even a glow worm to throw light
I see no chance of deliverance.
Through the mazy depths of gloom, I wade
Struck with the pestilence of rejection and hate
Hopes are now like shredded threads
Frayed away from a rope
I seek shade under a leafless tree
I hold on to a crutch as a prop
I curl up like a helpless embryo
Floating and swivelling in lucid agony
Shutters of distress is about to close in
Before that, I will my own death
In the absence of pall bearers
I shall carry my orphaned corpse
And walk the deserted road
Inching my way to the grave
Death
could be full of surprises.
I'm not Irish; but if you were to do
the full Irish thing - take my corpse out of the coffin,
dance wildly round the room with it one by one -
it'd make my day;
I'd remember it all my, death
and I bet you would too.
Though perhaps the tango would be a bit too far.
The funeral:
the not-too-many invitations should say
'Dress code: happy'. That I'd really like to see.
So I'll be standing at the lych-gate
like a reporter from the local rag
checking you in.
But if you don't attend - that's OK. I wouldn't like to die
a hypocrite; there'll be plenty of folk I shall be meeting
whose funeral I didn't attend, believing as I do
that funerals are for family and just those friends
who wouldn't miss it for the world.
Forget the flowers - I'd rather see flowers live until they die,
like me; not wither like day-brief memories,
as floral tributes flat on the slab like beached dolphins.
Sing the old favourites. And if you don't know the tunes or words,
I'm gently sorry for you - it's good to have them to remember, somewhere back there in the mind.
And if you must have little speeches,
I think I'll just take a stroll round the graveyard during that bit;
praise only makes me regret more what I didn't do.
Then if you're so busy that you leave after the service,
that's OK - but I'd like to think the best were still to come -
the 'do' afterwards - ah, I'll join you for that:
make it a good one; no food is too good
for the living. I'd like to be the one
handing round the plates of goodies;
whose forearm you gently touch in passing
to murmur a brief word about being missed
which may be truly meant
or found to be true.
I'm not really conversant with this recent 'Celebration' thing
though it seems an excellent idea, so positive:
I'd like it, then,  to be like that of my beloved friend, John:
where rather than just summon up memories and
share them with each other,
we seemed to be basking in the indescribable privilege
of his friendship
and his love;
which I guess in my case as in his would thus be truly
eternal.
Night funeral
In Harlem:
Where did they get
Them two fine cars?
Insurance man, he did not pay--
His insurance lapsed the other day--
Yet they got a satin box
for his head to lay.
Night funeral
In Harlem:
Who was it sent
That wreath of flowers?
Them flowers came
from that poor boy's friends--
They'll want flowers, too,
When they meet their ends.
Night funeral
in Harlem:
Who preached that
Black boy to his grave?
Old preacher man
Preached that boy away--
Charged Five Dollars
His girl friend had to pay.
Night funeral
In Harlem:
When it was all over
And the lid shut on his head
and the organ had done played
and the last prayers been said
and six pallbearers
Carried him out for dead
And off down Lenox Avenue
That long black hearse done sped,
The street light
At his corner
Shined just like a tear--
That boy that they was mournin'
Was so dear, so dear
To them folks that brought the flowers,
To that girl who paid the preacher man--
It was all their tears that made
That poor boy's
Funeral grand.
Night funeral
In Harlem.
The castle clock had tolled midnight:
With mattock and with spade,
And silent, by the torches' light,
His corse in earth we laid.
The coffin bore his name, that those
Of other years might know,
When earth its secrets should disclose,
Whose bones were laid below.
"Peace to the dead" no children sung,
Slow pacing up the nave,--
No prayers were read, no knell was rung,
As deep we dug his grave.
We only heard the winter's wind,
In many a sullen gust,
As, o'er the open grave inclined,
We murmured, "Dust to dust!"
A moonbeam from the arch's height
Streamed, as we placed the stone;
The long aisles started into light,
And all the windows shone.
We thought we saw the banners then,
That shook along the walls,
Whilst the sad shades of mailèd men
Were gazing on the stalls.
'Tis gone! again on tombs defaced
Sits darkness more profound;
And only by the torch we traced
The shadows on the ground.
And now the chilling, freezing air
Without blew long and loud;
Upon our knees we breathed one prayer,
Where he slept in his shroud.
We laid the broken marble floor,--
No name, no trace appears,--
And when we closed the sounding door,
We thought of him with tears.
I
Under the Great Comedian's tomb the crowd.
A bundle of tempestuous cloud is blown
About the sky; where that is clear of cloud
Brightness remains; a brighter star shoots down;
What shudders run through all that animal blood?
What is this sacrifice? Can someone there
Recall the Cretan barb that pierced a star?
Rich foliage that the starlight glittered through,
A frenzied crowd, and where the branches sprang
A beautiful seated boy; a sacred bow;
A woman, and an arrow on a string;
A pierced boy, image of a star laid low.
That woman, the Great Mother imaging,
Cut out his heart.  Some master of design
Stamped boy and tree upon Sicilian coin.
An age is the reversal of an age:
When strangers murdered Emmet, Fitzgerald, Tone,
We lived like men that watch a painted stage.
What matter for the scene, the scene once gone:
It had not touched our lives.  But popular rage,
Hysterica passio dragged this quarry down.
None shared our guilt; nor did we play a part
Upon a painted stage when we devoured his heart.
Come, fix upon me that accusing eye.
I thirst for accusation.  All that was sung.
All that was said in Ireland is a lie
Bred out of the c-ontagion of the throng,
Saving the rhyme rats hear before they die.
Leave nothing but the nothingS that belong
To this bare soul, let all men judge that can
Whether it be an animal or a man.
II
The rest I pass, one sentence I unsay.
Had de Valera eaten parnell's heart
No loose-lipped demagogue had won the day.
No civil rancour torn the land apart.
Had Cosgrave eaten parnell's heart, the land's
Imagination had been satisfied,
Or lacking that, government in such hands.
O'Higgins its sole statesman had not died.
Had even O'Duffy - but I name no more -
Their school a crowd, his master solitude;
Through Jonathan Swift's clark grove he passed, and there
plucked bitter wisdom that enriched his blood.
I attended the funeral of your dear one.
I heard your loud sobbing and screaming
As the coffin of your deceased husband
was carried out from the church aisle.
The black limousine was waiting outside
The caretaker looked at his watch
Each one picked up a white rose and
laid it on the coffin of your dear one.
Still the undertaker looked at you and waited;
You held on to the coffin and would not
Let the limousine drive off your husband-
to the burning heat of the crematorium.
The undertaker started the engine
You stood still sobbing, speaking and moaning
You drowned your heart in anguish so deep
But the funeral service should be culminated.
And the coffin was taken away by that black limousine
With a weak voice, you called, “Please come back”.
And you continued to sob without let up
The sting of death crushed your heart.
And there you stood with the presence
and comfort of your family and friends
No longer alone or bereft in the world
You were surrounded by those who wept
with you, who  stood beside you,
waiting when your anguish could subside.
______________________
Funeral of Frannie’s husband, September 5,2015
They bear him to his resting-place—
In slow procession sweeping by;
I follow at a stranger’s space;
His kindred they, his sweetheart I.
Unchanged my gown of garish dye,
Though sable-sad is their attire;
But they stand round with griefless eye,
Whilst my regret consumes like fire!
No drums, no marching and no bugles,
Not much crowd as expected
Only few relatives behind the anthill.
The President of ants has sent a deepest sympathy
That's saying; 'Sorry, I am not able to attend your funeral
As I have to be present in an Elephant's wedding.'
Fair is thy site, Sorrento, green thy shore,
Black crags behind thee pierce the clear blue skies;
The sea, whose borderers ruled the world of yore,
As clear and bluer still before thee lies.
Vesuvius smokes in sight, whose fount of fire,
Outgushing, drowned the cities on his steeps;
And murmuring Naples, spire o'ertopping spire,
Sits on the slope beyond where Virgil sleeps.
Here doth the earth, with flowers of every hue,
Heap her green breast when April suns are bright,
Flowers of the morning-red, or ocean-blue,
Or like the mountain frost of silvery white.
Currents of fragrance, from the orange tree,
And sward of violets, breathing to and fro,
Mingle, and wandering out upon the sea,
Refresh the idle boatsman where they blow.
Yet even here, as under harsher climes,
Tears for the loved and early lost are shed;
That soft air saddens with the funeral chimes,
Those shining flowers are gathered for the dead.
Here once a child, a smiling playful one,
All the day long caressing and caressed,
Died when its little tongue had just begun
To lisp the names of those it loved the best.
The father strove his struggling grief to quell,
The mother wept as mothers use to weep,
Two little sisters wearied them to tell
When their dear Carlo would awake from sleep.
Within an inner room his couch they spread,
His funeral couch; with mingled grief and love,
They laid a crown of roses on his head,
And murmured, 'Brighter is his crown above.'
They scattered round him, on the snowy sheet,
Laburnum's strings of sunny-coloured gems,
Sad hyacinths, and violets dim and sweet,
And orange blossoms on their dark green stems.
And now the hour is come, the priest is there;
Torches are lit and bells are tolled; they go,
With solemn rites of blessing and of prayer,
To lay the little corpse in earth below.
The door is opened; hark! that quick glad cry;
Carlo has waked, has waked, and is at play;
The little sisters laugh and leap, and try
To climb the bed on which the infant lay.
And there he sits alone, and gayly shakes
In his full hands, the blossoms red and white,
And smiles with winking eyes, like one who wakes
From long deep slumbers at the morning light.
They said you needed surgery.
You said ''There's business I must do.''
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?
What were your thoughts heading to the docs?
Did you know that you would die?
If I could turn back time and say
the things I'd like to say,
I'd say ''I love you'' and ''I'll miss you.''
''I wish that you could stay! ''
And there we stood, the family,
foremost in black and closed off faces.
Then sevenhundred folks from town,
they all had come to give respect
one final time to one who had
for 60 years been always there.
A fancy bell, with tiny light
would spell the words 'Right There',
as reassurance in advance
things will be soon alright.
Ungodly hours were the norm
for illness shuns convenience
three thousand souls had no one else
combined they stooped his shoulders.
The trusty horse, with cart or sled
had learned the timely lesson
would do his part until the end
there were occasions when a lad
of very small dimensions
could hitch a ride, observe raw life
in awe and love for father.
Though it was never very clear
exactly whether time
or duty kept the answers far
truth is that little eyes,
looked up with need and full of hope
for signs of some exotic
and somewhat undefinable
or needful expectation.
It never came, there never was
that gleam that little boys
do know to be the hug of minds
all winds were really cold.
And decades passed
and shyness ruled
the whip ruled our world
tradition was the handshake though,
a touching gesture, really.
'It's women's work, to hug and kiss
men have their solemn duties',
grandparents did seem mellower
and babysitters, scrumptious
would give the hugs and kisses, too
I do bless all those years
they were in evidence today
in deepest black and dark of face.
And like a naughty little boy
I watched their frozen faces
and wondered who was really sad
and who was here to just be seen
and what did I, myself, reveal
to my own soul today
to say good-bye, there was no choice
I could not give an answer.
It started snowing then, was cold
and what an inconvenience
the dust that each of us threw in
was mixed with flakes of white
I could not help but grin right then
'You gonna freeze your ass'.
We all went home, aware of death
a bit more for a week
there wasn't one who would have gone
in place of him, not one
and tiny thoughts, stirred up by words
of pastor's glowing sermon
reminded of mortality, today it was not time.
Gravedigger Johann closed the hole
I stayed behind to watch
he winked and spat tobacco juice
and said 'there lies a valued man
but all his stuff went with him.'
There was his brain, crammed full of facts
a spritely body, filled with duty
so many bones and other features,
oh, what a waste, to drown it all
within cheap dirt, and for the worms
a marble stone reminding
that what we have on mother earth
is something of no substance.
So will it matter what they think
when they go see the new one
the memory of their old Doc
it may just die  inside them,
or at the time when all of us
pass through our final hour
and only marble gravestones might
last just a few years longer.
"Yes," said the sister with the little pinched face,
The busy little sister with the funny little tract: —
"This is the climax, the grand fifth act.
There rides the proud, at the finish of his race.
There goes the hearse, the mourners cry,
The respectable hearse goes slowly by.
The wife of the dead has money in her purse,
The children are in health, so it might have been worse.
That fellow in the coffin led a life most foul.
A fierce defender of the red bar-tender,
At the church he would rail,
At the preacher he would howl.
He planted every deviltry to see it grow.
He wasted half his income on the lewd and the low.
He would trade engender for the red bar-tender,
He would homage render to the red bar-tender,
And in ultimate surrender to the red bar-tender,
He died of the tremens, as crazy as a loon,
And his friends were glad, when the end came soon.
There goes the hearse, the mourners cry,
The respectable hearse goes slowly by.
And now, good friends, since you see how it ends,
Let each nation-mender flay the red bar-tender, —
Abhor
The transgression
Of the red bar-tender, —
Ruin
The profession
Of the red bar-tender:
Force him into business where his work does good.
Let him learn how to plough, let him learn to chop wood,
Let him learn how to plough, let him learn to chop wood.
"The moral,
The conclusion,
The verdict now you know:—
'The saloon must go,
The saloon must go,
The saloon,
The saloon,
The saloon,
Must go.'"
"You are right, little sister," I said to myself,
"You are right, good sister," I said.
"Though you wear a mussy bonnet
On your little gray head,
You are right, little sister," I said.
The funeral bell is ringing a reminder of our mortality
Farewelling a deceased soul one day 'twill ring for me
Ringing in the stillness of this cool Autumn day
Across the rural city in the morning damp and gray.
The funeral bell is pealing for one a last farewell
And few sounds sadder than the slow peals of the loud funeral bell
Above the streets and houses it echoes to the sky
For one bound for her or his last resting place the cemetery nearby.
The peewees in the town park distinctive in their call
And the magpie on a wattle pipe on this cool morning in the Fall
And for one who will not breathe again the eulogy is read
And the funeral bell is tolling in memory of the dead.
The funeral bell is ringing for one a last goodbye
And on the clock of our mortality the hours just seem to fly
Respect to the departed is all that we can pay
And for each and everyone of us a final night and day.
A GLORIOUS voice hath ceased!-
Mournfully, reverently-the funeral chant
Breathe reverently! There is a dreamy sound,
A hollow murmur of the dying year,
In the deep woods. Let it be wild and sad!
A more Aeolian melancholy tone
Than ever wail'd o'er bright things perishing!
For that is passing from the darken'd land,
Which the green summer will not bring us back-
Though all her songs return. The funeral chant
Breathe reverently!-They bear the mighty forth,
The kingly ruler in the realms of mind-
They bear him through the household paths, the groves,
Where every tree had music of its own
To his quick ear of knowledge taught by love-
And he is silent!-Past the living stream
They bear him now; the stream, whose kindly voice
On alien shores his true heart burn'd to hear-
And he is silent! O'er the heathery hills,
Which his own soul had mantled with a light
Richer than autumn's purple, now they move-
And he is silent!-he, whose flexile lips
Were but unseal'd, and lo! a thousand forms,
From every pastoral glen and fern-clad height,
In glowing life upsprang:-Vassal and chief,
Rider and steed, with shout and bugle-peal,
Fast rushing through the brightly troubled air,
Like the wild huntsman's band. And still they live,
To those fair scenes imperishably bound,
And, from the mountain mist still flashing by,
Startle the wanderer who hath listen'd there
To the seer's voice: phantoms of colour'd thought,
Surviving him who raised.-O eloquence!
O power, whose breathings thus could wake the dead!
Who shall wake thee? lord of the buried past!
And art thou there-to those dim nations join'd,
Thy subject-host so long?-The wand is dropp'd
The bright lamp broken, which the gifted hand
Touch'd, and the genii came!-Sing reverently
The funeral chant!-The mighty is borne home-
And who shall be his mourners?-Youth and age,
For each hath felt his magic-love and grief,
For he hath communed with the heart of each:
Yes-the free spirit of humanity
May join the august procession, for to him
Its mysteries have been tributary things,
And all its accents known:-from field or wave,
Never was conqueror on his battle bier,
By the vail'd banner and the muffled drum,
And the proud drooping of the crested head,
More nobly follow'd home.-The last abode,
The voiceless dwelling of the bard is reach'd:
A still majestic spot: girt solemnly
With all the imploring beauty of decay;
A stately couch 'midst ruins! meet for him
With his bright fame to rest in, as a king
Of other days, laid lonely with his sword
Beneath his head. Sing reverently the chant
Over the honour'd grave!-the grave!-oh, say
Rather the shrine!-An alter for the love,
The light, soft pilgrim steps, the votive wreaths
Of years unborn-a place where leaf and flower,
By that which dies not of the sovereign dead,
Shall be made holy things-where every weed
Shall have its portion of the inspiring gift
From buried glory breathed. And now, what strain,
Making victorious melody ascend
High above sorrow's dirge, befits the tomb
Where he that sway'd the nations thus is laid-
The crown'd of men?
A lowly, lowly, song.
Lowly and solemn be
Thy children's cry to Thee,
Father divine!
A hymn of suppliant breath,
Owning that life and death
Alike are Thine!
A spirit on its way,
Sceptred the earth to sway,
From Thee was sent:
Now call'st Thou back Thine own-
Hence is that radiance flown-
To earth but lent.
Watching in breathless awe,
The bright head bow'd we saw,
Beneath Thy hand!
Fill'd by one hope, one fear,
Now o'er a brother's bier,
Weeping we stand.
How hath he pass'd!-the lord
Of each deep bosom chord,
To meet Thy sight,
Unmantled and alone,
On Thy bless'd mercy thrown,
O Infinite!
So, from his harvest home,
Must the tired peasant come;
So, in one trust,
Leader and king must yield
The naked soul, reveal'd
To Thee, All Just!
The sword of many of a fight-
What then shall be its might?
The lofty lay,
That rush'd on eagle wing-
What shall its memory bring?
What hope, what stay?
O Father! in that hour,
When earth all succouring power
Shall disavow;
When spear, and shield, and crown,
In faintness are cast down-
Sustain us, Thou!
By Him who bow'd to take
The death-cup for our sake,
The thorn, the rod;
From whom the last dismay
Was not to pass away-
Aid us, O God!
Tremblers beside the grave,
We call on thee to save.
Father divine!
Hear, hear our suppliant breath,
Keep us, in life and death,
Thine, only Thine!
Zeus mourns deeply:
Patroklos has killed Sarpedon.
Now Patroklos and the Achaians rush on
to snatch up the body, to dishonour it.
But Zeus doesn't tolerate that at all.
Though he let his favourite child be killed
this the Law required
he'll at least honour him after death.
So he now sends Apollo down to the plain
with instructions about how the body should be tended.
Apollo reverently raises the hero's body
and carries it in sorrow to the river.
He washes the dust and blood away,
heals the terrible wounds so there's no trace left,
pours perfume of ambrosia over it,
and dresses it in radiant Olympian robes.
He bleaches the skin, and with a pearl comb
combs out the jet black hair.
He spreads and arranges the beautiful limbs.
Now he looks like a young king, a royal charioteer-
twenty-five or twenty-six years old-
resting himself after winning
the prize in a famous race,
his chariot all gold and his horses the fastest.
Having finished his task this way,
Apollo calls for the two brothers,
Sleep and Death, and orders them
to take the body to Lykia, the rich country.
So the two brothers, Sleep and Death,
set off on foot toward the rich country, Lykia;
and when they reached the door
of the king's palace,
they handed over the honoured body
and then returned to their other concerns.
And once the body was received in the palace
the sad burial began, with processions and honours and dirges,
with many libations from sacred vessels,
with all pomp and circumstance.
Then skilled workers from the city
and celebrated craftsmen in stone
came to make the tombstone and the tomb.
Ye sons of Germany, your noble Emperor William now is dead.
Who oft great armies to battle hath led;
He was a man beloved by his subjects all,
Because he never tried them to enthral.
The people of Germany have cause now to mourn,
The loss of their hero, who to them will ne'er return;
But his soul I hope to Heaven has fled away,
To the realms of endless bliss for ever and aye.
He was much respected throughout Europe by the high and the low,
And all over Germany people's hearts are full of woe;
For in the battlefield he was a hero bold,
Nevertheless, a lover of peace, to his credit be it told.
'Twas in the year of 1888, and on March the 16th day,
That the peaceful William's remains were conveyed away
To the royal mausoleum of Charlottenburg, their last resting-place,
The God-fearing man that never did his country disgrace.
The funeral service was conducted in the cathedral by the court chaplain, Dr. Kogel,
Which touched the hearts of his hearers, as from his lips it fell,
And in conclusion he recited the Lord's Prayer
In the presence of kings, princes, dukes, and counts assembled there.
And at the end of the service the infantry outside fired volley after volley,
While the people inside the cathedral felt melancholy,
As the sound of the musketry smote upon the ear,
In honour of the illustrous William, whom they loved most dear.
Then there was a solemn pause as the kings and princes took their places,
Whilst the hot tears are trickling down their faces,
And the mourners from shedding tears couldn't refrain;
And in respect of the good man, above the gateway glared a bituminous flame.
Then the coffin was placed on the funeral car,
By the kings and princes that came from afar;
And the Crown Prince William heads the procession alone,
While behind him are the four heirs-apparent to the throne.
Then followed the three Kings of Saxony, and the King of the Belgians also,
Together with the Prince of Wales, with their hearts full of woe,
Besides the Prince of Naples and Prince Rudolph of Austria were there,
Also the Czarevitch, and other princes in their order I do declare.
And as the procession passes the palace the blinds are drawn completely,
And every house is half hidden with the sable drapery;
And along the line of march expansive arches were erected,
While the spectators standing by seemed very dejected.
And through the Central Avenue, to make the decorations complete,
There were pedestals erected, rising fourteen to fifteen feet,
And at the foot and top of each pedestal were hung decorations of green bay,
Also beautiful wreaths and evergreen festoons all in grand array.
And there were torches fastened on pieces of wood stuck in the ground;
And as the people gazed on the weird-like scene, their silence was profound;
And the shopkeepers closed their shops, and hotel-keepers closed in the doorways,
And with torchlight and gaslight, Berlin for once was all ablaze.
The authorities of Berlin in honour of the Emperor considered it no sin,
To decorate with crape the beautiful city of Berlin;
Therefore Berlin I declare was a city of crape,
Because few buildings crape decoration did escape.
First in the procession was the Emperor's bodyguard,
And his great love for them nothing could it retard;
Then followed a squadron of the hussars with their band,
Playing "Jesus, Thou my Comfort," most solemn and grand.
And to see the procession passing the sightseers tried their best,
Especially when the cavalry hove in sight, riding four abreast;
Men and officers with their swords drawn, a magnificent sight to see
In the dim sun's rays, their burnished swords glinting dimly.
Then followed the footguards with slow and solemn tread,
Playing the "Dead March in Saul," most appropriate for the dead;
And behind them followed the artillery, with four guns abreast,
Also the ministers and court officials dressed in their best.
The whole distance to the grave was covered over with laurel and bay,
So that the body should be borne along smoothly all the way;
And the thousands of banners in the procession were beautiful to view,
Because they were composed of cream-coloured silk and light blue.
There were thousands of thousands of men and women gathered there,
And standing ankle deep in snow, and seemingly didn't care
So as they got a glimpse of the funeral car,
Especially the poor souls that came from afar.
And when the funeral car appeared there was a general hush,
And the spectators in their anxiety to see began to crush;
And when they saw the funeral car by the Emperor's charger led,
Every hat and cap was lifted reverently from off each head.
And as the procession moved on to the royal mausoleum,
The spectators remained bareheaded and seemingly quite dumb;
And as the coffin was borne into its last resting-place,
Sorrow seemed depicted in each one's face.
And after the burial service the mourners took a last farewell
Of the noble-hearted William they loved so well;
Then rich and poor dispersed quietly that were assembled there,
While two batteries of field-guns fired a salute which did rend the air
In honour of the immortal hero they loved so dear,
The founder of the Fatherland Germany, that he did revere.
'Twas in the year of 1888, and on the 19th of November,
Which the friends of the late Ex-Provost Rough will long remember,
Because 'twas on the 19th of November his soul took its flight
To the happy land above, the land of pure delight.
Take him for all in all, he was a very good man,
And during his Provostship he couldn't be equalled in Great Britain,
Which I proclaim to the world without any dread,
Because while Provost he reduced the public-houses to three hundred.
Whereas at the time there were 620 public-houses in the town,
But being a friend of the temperance cauae he did frown,
Because he saw the evils of intemperance every day
While sitting on the bench, so he resolved to sweep public-houses away.
And in doing so the good man, in my opinion, was right,
Because the evils of intemperance is an abomination in God's sight;
And all those that get drunk are enemies to Him,
Likewise enemies to Christ's kingdom, which is a great sin.
The late Ex-Provost Rough was President of the Dundee Temperance Society,
An office which he filled with great ability;
Besides Vice-President of the Scottish Temperance League for many years,
And no doubt the friends of temperance for his loss will shed tears.
Because many a hungry soul he relieved while in distress,
And for doing so I hope the Lord will him bless,
For his kindness towards the poor people in Dundee,
Besides for his love towards the temperance cause, and his integrity.
And when the good man's health began to decline
The doctor ordered him to take each day two glasses of wine,
But he soon saw the evil of it, and from it he shrunk,
The noble old patriarch, for fear of getting drunk.
And although the doctor advised him to continue taking the wine,
Still the hero of the temperance cause did decline,
And told the doctor he wouldn't of wine take any more,
So in a short time his spirit fled to heaven, where all troubles are o'er.
I'm sure very little good emanates from strong drink,
And many people, alas! it leads to hell's brink!
Some to the scaffold, and some to a pauper's grave,
Whereas if they would abstain from drink, Christ would them save.
'Twas on Friday afternoon, in November the 23rd day,
That the funeral cortege to the Western Cemetery wended its way,
Accompanied by the Magistrates, and amongst those present were-
Bailie Macdonald and Bailie Black, also Lord Provost Hunter I do declare.
There were also Bailie Foggie, Bailie Craig, and Bailie Stephenson,
And Ex-Provost Moncur, and Ex-Provost Ballingall representing the Royal Orphan Institution;
Besides there were present the Rev. J. Jenkins and the Rev. J. Masson,
With grief depicted in their faces and seemingly woe-begone.
There were also Mr Henry Adams, representing the Glover trade,
Also Mr J. Carter, who never was afraid
To denounce strong drink, and to warn the people from it to flee,
While agent of the Temperance Society in Dundee.
And when the funeral cortege arrived at the Western burying-ground,
Then the clergyman performed the funeral service with a solemn sound;
While from the eyes of the spectators fell many a tear
For the late Ex-Provost Rough they loved so dear.
And when the coffin was lowered into its house of clay,
Then the friends of the deceased homewards wended their way,
Conversing on the good qualities of the good man,
Declaring that the late Ex-Provost Rough couldn't be equalled in Great Britain.
Alas! Prince Henry of Battenberg is dead!
And, I hope, has gone to heaven, its streets to tread,
And to sing with God's saints above,
Where all is joy and peace and love.
'Twas in the year of 1896, and on the 5th of February,
Prince Henry was buried at Whippingham- a solemn sight to see.
As the funeral moved off, it was a very impressive sight-
First came the military, and police, and volunteers from the Isle of Wight.
Then came the carriage party of the Scots Guards;
While the people uncovered their heads as it passed onwards
And many of them did sob and sigh
When the gun carriage with the coffin was passing by.
Prince Henry's charger was led by Richter, his stud groom;
And depicted in the people's faces there was a sad gloom
When they saw the noble charger of the dead-
It seemed that all joy from them had fled.
The Queen's carriage was followed by the Princess of Wales, and other Princesses,
All clad in gorgeous mourning dresses;
And there was a number of military representatives, which enhanced the scene;
And as the procession moved along it was solemn in the extreme.
Her Majesty looked very sad and serene,
Leaning back in her carriage could plainly be seen;
And the carriage was drawn by a pair of greys in grand harness;
And Her Majesty seemed to be in deep distress.
By Her Majesty's side sat the Princess Beatrice
And the two younger Battenberg children, looking very nice;
And by the coffin walked the elder Prince, immediately
Between Prince Louis and Prince Joseph, holding their hands tenderly.
The "Dead March" was played by the Marine Band;
And the music was solemn and very grand,
And accompanied by the roll of muffled drums;
Whilst among the spectators were heard sighs and hums.
And when the procession arrived at the church of Whippingham,
Then the coffin was carried inside- of the good man-
And was then laid in its resting place,
While sorrow was depicted in every face.
Then there was the firing of guns, with their earthly Thunder
Which made the people start and wonder;
And the tolling of the village bells,
While the solemn music on the air swells.
And the people said, "Prince Henry was a good man,
But now he's laid low in the church of Whippingham."
But when the Grim King his dart does throw,
None can escape death, high or low.
The funeral service was certainly very nice-
Which was by the request of Princess Beatrice-
Which was the rendering of Sullivan's anthem, "Brother, before us thou art gone"-
I hope unto thy heavenly home.
No Doubt the Princess Beatrice will mourn for him-
But to mourn for the dead it is a sin!
Therefore I hope God will comfort her always,
And watch o'er her children night and day.
Prince Henry was a God-fearing man-
And to deny it few people can-
And very kind to his children dear,
And for the loss of him they will drop a tear.
His relatives covered the coffin lid with wreaths of flowers,
While adown their cheeks flowed tears in showers.
Then the service concluded with "Christ will gather His own";
And each one left with a sad heart and went home.
The Day that
Youth
had died,
There came to his grave-side,
In decent mourning, from the country’s ends,
Those scatter’d friends
Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
In feast and wine and many-crown’d carouse,
The days and nights and dawnings of the time
When
Youth
kept open house,
Nor left untasted
Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,
No quest of his unshar’d—
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar’d,
Followed their old friend’s bier.
Folly
went first,
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers’d;
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand—
Laughter,
most hoarse, and Captain
Pride
with tanned
And martial face all grim, and fussy
Joy
Who had to catch a train, and
Lust,
poor, snivelling boy;
These bore the dear departed.
Behind them, broken-hearted,
Came
Grief,
so noisy a widow, that all said,
“Had he but wed
Her elder sister
Sorrow,
in her stead!”
And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,
The fatherless children,
Colour, Tune,
and
Rhyme
(The sweet lad
Rhyme
), ran all-uncomprehending.
Then, at the way’s sad ending,
Round the raw grave they stay’d. Old
Wisdom
read,
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.
There stood
Romance,
The furrowing tears had mark’d her rougèd cheek;
Poor old
Conceit,
his wonder unassuaged;
Dead
Innocency’s
daughter,
Ignorance;
And shabby, ill-dress’d
Generosity;
And
Argument,
too full of woe to speak;
Passion,
grown portly, something middle-aged;
And
Friendship
—not a minute older, she;
Impatience,
ever taking out his watch;
Faith,
who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch
Old
Wisdom’s
endless drone.
Beauty
was there,
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
Poor maz’d Imagination;
Fancy
wild;
Ardour,
the sunlight on his greying hair;
Contentment,
who had known
Youth
as a child
And never seen him since. And
Spring
came too,
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers—
She did not stay for long.
And
Truth,
and
Grace,
and all the merry crew,
The laughing
Winds
and
Rivers,
and lithe
Hours;
And
Hope,
the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing
Song;
—
Yes, with much woe and mourning general,
At dead
Youth’s
funeral,
Even these were met once more together, all,
Who erst the fair and living
Youth
did know;
All, except only
Love. Love
had died long ago.
Silver handles on a casket of steel
Reflecting sunlight...cold and unreal...
Sinking deep into hallowed ground
As the grief-stricken gather 'round.
A mothers tears hidden behind a veil
Youngsters with faces...ghostly pale,
Friends and family of a beloved gone...
A scene too frequent and painfully wrong.
Naught in time could have a greater cost
Than the life of a child to violence lost!
Hushed phone calls litter the day, and
Arouse my curiosity. Mum looks tired.
Dad looks sad.
I don’t understand.
I’m told we’re going down South.
To see Grandad.
The journey is cold and static,
Everyone keeps sighing.
I feel left out and don’t know what to say.
We arrive in the dead of night, and
I have to go to bed.
As I climb the stairs I see my uncles
all shaking hands and patting each other
on the back. My Dad goes to join them.
They all look sad,
and I’m left confused.
As I lay on my Aunt and Uncle’s
creaking spare bed, covered only by
An itchy blanket and my cold, clammy t-shirt,
I strain to hear the hushed murmurs
that escape from downstairs. I fall
asleep with echoes of “…. nice we think he’d
appreciate, ” ringing in my ears,
not knowing quite what it could mean.
The next morning, I’m woken up early, and dressed
in my Sunday best.
Everyone still looks sad.
So I try and be sad, too.
An Uncle comes in through my breakfast,
and announces the cars are here.
Everyone looks at their feet,
and talks in mumbles.
I’ve no idea what he meant, but I looked at my feet too.
I follow my parents out to a big, black car in the street,
and feel disappointed that this doesn’t seem an appropriate time
to be excited about riding in a really long car.
We travel in complete silence, no-one says a thing.
They all just keep looking sad.
We stopped at the place where they buried people,
and made a long line behind a wooden box
on six men’s shoulders. My Dad was one of them.
He looked so sad, sombre and solemn. Yet proud as well.
That confused me.
We started walking and an Aunt began to cry.
I’d never seen an adult cry before.
I thought they were strong and invincible,
Like the Power Rangers.
More people started crying and it upset me too.
Something bad must have happened.
We gathered round the grave, compressed together like a fortress
trying to stop bad things from getting inside.
After the priest had read a few words,
the silence sang out. It sang so loud
that it made more people cry.
Nothingness boomed round the churchyard,
bouncing and echoing off the headstones,
louder and more conspicuous than any rock music.
I was lost; bewildered.
In my dazed upset, I tugged on Mummy’s sleeve,
and asked her where Grandad was, we were supposed
to be here to see Grandad.
She knelt to me, trying not to cry,
and told me “Grandad is in Heaven now, we’re here
to say goodbye.”
I said goodbye to my Grandad,
but not at his graveside, surrounded by soil and tears.
I couldn’t bear to look into that hole to see
it reflect the hollowness in my heart and mind, and
the emptiness left in all our lives.
I would honour his memory my own way.
I’d remember the happiness he brought.
I’d remember him as I saw him last,
and say goodbye in thought
MARK you not yon sad procession;
'Mid the ruin'd abbey's gloom,
Hastening to the worm's possession,
To the dark and silent tomb!
See the velvet pall hangs over
Poor mortality's remains;
We should shudder to discover
What that coffin's space contains.
Death itself is lovely—wearing
But the colder shape of sleep;
Or the solemn statue bearing
Beauty that forbids to weep.
But decay—the pulses tremble
When its livid signs appear;
When the once-loved lips resemble
All we loathe, and all we fear.
Is it not a ghastly ending
For the body's godlike form,
Thus to the damp earth descending,
Food and triumph to the worm?
Better far the red pile blazing
With the spicy Indian wood,
Incense unto heaven raising
From the sandal oil's sweet flood.
In the bright pyre's kindling flashes,
Let my yielded soul ascend;
Fling to the wild winds my ashes
'Till with mother-earth they blend.
Not so,—let the pale urn keep them;
Touch'd with spices, oil, and wine;
Let there be some one to weep them;
Wilt thou keep that urn? Love mine!
He showed me to a room
With dimmed lights and
Soft, soulful music.
It was appropriate.
I told the funeral director
I would do the laying out myself
It was important to me.
I would call him when finished.
He smiled the smile of an undertaker.
Did he understand how I felt?
The coffin was unlined
No need of white satin now.
I've brought with me the white box.
Do you remember it?
The one, which held all our keepsakes?
Well… it was silly me that insisted,
I thought they'd be good to look back on.
There's no need of them now.
What use are trinkets anyway?
The little pressed flower from
Our first meeting.
It looks so black and sad now.
Don't you think so?
The gold locket with its broken chain.
(It was tin really, but I never complained.)
My wedding veil with its double layer,
I could hardly see you, but I sensed you.
You were rigid. I thought it was wedding nerves.
Oh look! The photo of you blowing kisses
Toward the camera.
But it wasn't me taking the picture,
Just someone we'd met on honeymoon.
Sarina. She was very pregnant wasn't she?
And very happy too.
We kept in touch for a while.
Here's another one, of me this time.
Oh dear. It's the one with the black eye,
You were throwing pebbles at the beach
And one accidentally hit me. Remember?
It bled quite a lot didn't it?
The doctor was very quizzical,
But I managed to convince him in the end.
Oh look.
Here's the recording Sarina sent us
Of the baby's first cry.
She named the baby after you
Didn't she.
Oh I do babble on don't I?
I'd best get on with the packing,
There's quite a lot in here really.
I think I'll just tie it into one big bundle
And make a list on the package
With a laundry marker so it wont fade
And put it in the coffin.
CONTENTS:
Various nick-nacks
Lies
Controlling
Bullying
Disrespect
Anger
Impatience
Ridicule
Violence
Infidelity
Oh I nearly forgot. (silly me.)
Fear.
How could I forget that!
Fear was the most prominent wasn't it?
Never mind, it's on the list now
And all packed away.
The funeral car has arrived
But no hearse.
I'll carry the coffin on my knee.
I only needed a small one
As I packed everything tightly together.
There'll be no need of a service.
No need to waste money unnecessarily.
By the way, I packed some candles
And calamine lotion too.
I know it will be dark at your new place
And the heat overpowering.
It's time to go now but I was just wondering...
Will Sarina write a similar list
When her time comes.
10/03/2016
Weasel words
with easy starts
are not the first
ones to our hearts
when the cold cadaver light of day
takes one of those we love away
After the funeral
- when the funeral was over
- After we had buried him
We walked across the grass
...We walked across the grass
leaving footprints in the dew
footprints in the dew
How was that possible
’God’s name how was that possible
with him forever
And now, forever
footprints forever
looking back across the grass
The warmth of the day
losing us all, forever
The funeral procession drove past my house
I bowed my head and I was quite as a mouse,
In a solemn prayer I gave to the sadly departed
As I knew of the sadness and remorse of the fainthearted;
One car after another I watched go down the street
As I still stood there in respect in this unbearable heat,
The cars that I counted they were over twenty-five
Sadly not one visited the departed when he was still alive;
So, there goes his procession heading to the graveyard
As though being led by weepers and the national guard,
I guess when he was living his life he was always misread
Now he is missed and remembered since now he is dead.
Randy L. McClave
The Rose was sick, and smiling died;
And, being to be sanctified,
About the bed, there sighing stood
The sweet and flowery sisterhood.
Some hung the head, while some did bring,
To wash her, water from the spring;
Some laid her forth, while others wept,
But all a solemn fast there kept.
The holy sisters some among,
The sacred dirge and trental sung;
But ah!  what sweets smelt everywhere,
As heaven had spent all perfumes there!
At last, when prayers for the dead,
And rites, were all accomplished,
They, weeping, spread a lawny loom,
And closed her up as in a tomb.
Eight Parts of Speech this Day wear Mourning Gowns
Declin'd Verbs, Pronouns, Participles, Nouns.
And not declined, Adverbs and Conjunctions,
In Lillies Porch they stand to do their functions.
With Preposition; but the most affection
Was still observed in the Interjection.
The Substantive seeming the limbed best,
Would set an hand to bear him to his Rest.
The Adjective with very grief did say,
Hold me by strength, or I shall faint away.
The Clouds of Tears did over-cast their faces,
Yea all were in most lamentable Cases.
The five Declensions did the Work decline,
And Told the Pronoun Tu, The work is thine:
But in this case those have no call to go
That want the Vocative, and can't say O!
The Pronouns said that if the Nouns were there,
There was no need of them, they might them spare:
But for the sake of Emphasis they would,
In their Discretion do what ere they could.
Great honour was confer'd on Conjugations,
They were to follow next to the Relations.
Amo did love him best, and Doceo might
Alledge he was his Glory and Delight.
But Lego said by me he got his skill,
And therefore next the Herse I follow will.
Audio said little, hearing them so hot,
Yet knew by him much Learning he had got.
O Verbs the Active were, Or Passive sure,
Sum to be Neuter could not well endure.
But this was common to them all to Moan
Their load of grief they could not soon Depone.
A doleful Day for Verbs, they look so moody,
They drove Spectators to a Mournful Study.
The Verbs irregular, 'twas thought by some,
Would break no rule, if they were pleas'd to come.
Gaudeo could not be found; fearing disgrace
He had with-drawn, sent Maereo in his Place.
Possum did to the utmost he was able,
And bore as Stout as if he'd been A Table.
Volo was willing, Nolo some-what stout,
But Malo rather chose, not to stand out.
Possum and Volo wish'd all might afford
Their help, but had not an Imperative Word.
Edo from Service would by no means Swerve,
Rather than fail, he thought the Cakes to Serve.
Fio was taken in a fit, and said,
By him a Mournful POEM should be made.
Fero was willing for to bear a part,
Altho' he did it with an aking heart.
Feror excus'd, with grief he was so Torn,
He could not bear, he needed to be born.
Such Nouns and Verbs as we defective find,
No Grammar Rule did their attendance bind.
They were excepted, and exempted hence,
But Supines, all did blame for negligence.
Verbs Offspring, Participles hand-in-hand,
Follow, and by the same direction stand:
The rest Promiscuously did croud and cumber,
Such Multitudes of each, they wanted Number.
Next to the Corpse to make th' attendance even,
Jove, Mercury, Apollo came from heaven.
And Virgil, Cato, gods, men, Rivers, Winds,
With Elegies, Tears, Sighs, came in their kinds.
Ovid from Pontus hast's Apparrell'd thus,
In Exile-weeds bringing De Tristibus:
And Homer sure had been among the Rout,
But that the Stories say his Eyes were out.
Queens, Cities, Countries, Islands, Come
All Trees, Birds, Fishes, and each Word in Um.
What Syntax here can you expect to find?
Where each one bears such discomposed mind.
Figures of Diction and Construction,
Do little: Yet stand sadly looking on.
That such a Train may in their motion chord,
Prosodia gives the measure Word for Word.
She collected the deceased from the mortuary
She washed the body down seeing the body peacefully free
Then she dressed the body in what 'The family' had chose
Now dressed so bright, holding a RED rose
She then collected an upstanding coffin that was lined along the wall...
Carefully placing it on a pedestal
So ready to drill the handles and line the coffin with lace
Then engraving the name plate at a steady pace
She then went back to the body and with family instructions
She added powder, blush then a little lipstick on
Then with 6 steady hands, placed her in
Into her pure white coffin where there would be only sleep ins
The 6 steady hands placed the body for the family to see
They all cried and cried... just could not believe
Could not believe she was gone and here no more
They knew they had to accept even though they were raw
The grieving Funeral Director had arranged the funeral as she knew how to do
She had placed the Funeral Notices and Ordered the flowers too
At the Cemetery Gate she walked and smiled in front of the Hearse
In Gods garden she was practising her verse
Her verse of hope and support that she would read to the family today
A verse to help them accept, there is no other way
So the reading went well..., the music had played
Family so happy they said: 'I wish not  to see you again... I'm afraid! '
*****************
This Grieving Funeral Director took a little sadness with her from each Funeral. Yet the pure satisfaction she received from helping these Grieving families was so well worth it.

LYN PAUL
Then died, lamented, in the strength of life,
A valued mother, and a faithful wife:
Call'd not away, when time had loosed each hold
On the fond heart, and each desire grew cold;
But when, to all that knit us to our kind,
She felt fast bound, as charity can bind; -
Not when the ills of age, its pain, its care,
The drooping spirit for its fate prepare;
And, each affection failing, leaves the heart
Loosed from life's charm, and willing to depart; -
But all her ties the strong invader broke,
In all their strength, by on tremendous stroke!
Sudden and swift the eager pest came on,
And terror grew, till every hope was gone;
Still those around appear'd for hope to seek:
But view'd the sick, and were afraid to speak.
Slowly they bore, with solemn step, the dead;
When grief grew loud, and bitter tears were shed,
My part began: a crowd drew near the place,
Awe in each eye, alarm in every face;
So swift the ill, and of so fierce a kind,
That fear with pity mingled in each mind;
Friends with the husband came, their griefs to blend;
For good-man Frankford was to all a friend.
The last-born boy they held above the bier;
He knew not grief, but cries express'd his fear;
Each different age and sex reveal'd its pain,
In now a louder, now a lower strain!
While the meek father, listening to their tones,
Swell'd the full cadence of the grief by groans.
The elder sister strove her pangs to hide,
And soothing words to younger minds applied:
'Be still, be patient;' oft she strove to say,
But fail'd as oft, and weeping turn'd away.
Curious and sad, upon the fresh-dug hill,
The village lads stood melancholy still;
And idle children, wandering to and fro,
As nature guided, took the tone of woe.
Arrived at home, how then they gazed around,
In every place - where she - no more was found: -
The seat at table she was wont to fill;
The fireside chair, still set, but vacant still;
The garden-walks, a labour all her own;
The latticed bower, with trailing shrubs o'ergrown;
The Sunday pew she fill'd with all her race, -
Each place of hers was now a sacred place:
That, while it call'd up sorrows in the eyes,
Pierced the full heart, and forced them still to rise.
Ye sigh not when the sun, his course fulfilled,
His glorious course, rejoicing earth and sky,
In the soft evening, when the winds are stilled,
Sinks where his islands of departure spread
O'er the warm-colored heaven and ruddy mountain head.
Why weep ye then for him, who, having won
The bound of man's appointed years, at last.
Life's blessings all enjoyed, life's labors done,
Serenely to his final rest has passed;
While the soft memory of his virtues yet
Lingers like twilight hues, when the bright sun is set?
What! and not one to heave the pious sigh!
Not one whose sorrow-swoln and aching eye
For social scenes, for life's endearments fled,
Shall drop a tear and dwell upon the dead!
Poor wretched Outcast! I will weep for thee,
And sorrow for forlorn humanity.
Yes I will weep, but not that thou art come
To the stern Sabbath of the silent tomb:
For squalid Want, and the black scorpion Care,
Heart-withering fiends! shall never enter there.
I sorrow for the ills thy life has known
As thro' the world's long pilgrimage, alone,
Haunted by Poverty and woe-begone,
Unloved, unfriended, thou didst journey on:
Thy youth in ignorance and labour past,
And thine old age all barrenness and blast!
Hard was thy Fate, which, while it doom'd to woe,
Denied thee wisdom to support the blow;
And robb'd of all its energy thy mind,
Ere yet it cast thee on thy fellow-kind,
Abject of thought, the victim of distress,
To wander in the world's wide wilderness.
Poor Outcast sleep in peace! the wintry storm
Blows bleak no more on thine unshelter'd form;
Thy woes are past; thou restest in the tomb;--
I pause--and ponder on the days to come.
The muffled drum rolled on the air,
Warriors, with stately step, were there;
On every arm was the black crape bound,
Every carbine was turned to the ground;
Solemn, the sound of their measured tread,
As silent and slow, they followed the dead.
The riderless horse was led in the rear;
There were white plumes waving over the bier;
Helmet and sword were laid on the pall,
For, it was a soldier's funeral.
That soldier had stood on the battle plain,
Where every step was over the slain;
But the brand and the ball had passed him by,
And he came to his native land, to die.
'Twas hard to come to that native land,
And not clasp one familiar hand;
'Twas hard to be numbered amid the dead,
Before he could hear his welcome said.
But, 'twas something to see its cliffs once more,
And to lay his bones on his own loved shore;
To think, that the friends of his youth might weep,
O'er the green grass turf of the soldier's sleep.
The bugles ceased their wailing sound,
As the coffin was lowered into the ground;
A volley was fired, a blessing said,
One moment's pause, and they left the dead.
I saw a poor and aged man -
His step was feeble, his cheek was wan;
He knelt him down on the new-raised mound,
His face was bowed on the cold damp ground;
He raised his head, his tears were done -
The father had prayed o'er his only son.
I.
Thus long my grief has kept me dumb:
Sure there's a lethargy in mighty woe,
Tears stand congealed, and cannot flow;
And the sad soul retires into her inmost room:
Tears, for a stroke foreseen, afford relief;
But, unprovided for a sudden blow,
Like Niobe, we marble grow,
And petrify with grief.
Our British heaven was all serene,
No threatening cloud was nigh,
Not the least wrinkle to deform the sky;
We lived as unconcerned and happily
As the first age in nature's golden scene;
Supine amidst our flowing store,
We slept securely, and we dreamt of more;
When suddenly the thunder-clap was heard,
It took us, unprepared, and out of guard,
Already lost before we feared.
The amazing news of Charles at once were spread,
At once the general voice declared,
“Our gracious prince was dead.”
No sickness known before, no slow disease,
To soften grief by just degrees;
But, like a hurricane on Indian seas,
The tempest rose;
An unexpected burst of woes.
With scarce a breathing space betwixt,
This now becalmed, and perishing the next.
As if great Atlas from his height
Should sink beneath his heavenly weight,
And, with a mighty flaw, the flaming wall,
As once it shall,
Should gape immense, and, rushing down, o'erwhelm this nether ball;
So swift and so surprising was our fear:
Our Atlas fell indeed; but Hercules was near.
II.
His pious brother, sure the best
Who ever bore that name,
Was newly risen from his rest,
And, with a fervent flame,
His usual morning vows had just addressed,
For his dear sovereign's health;
And hoped to have them heard,
In long increase of years,
In honour, fame, and wealth:
Guiltless of greatness, thus he always prayed,
Nor knew nor wished those vows he made,
On his own head should be repaid.
Soon as the ill-omen'd rumour reached his ear,
(Ill news is winged with fate, and flies apace),
Who can describe the amazement in his face!
Horror in all his pomp was there,
Mute and magnificent, without a tear;
And then the hero first was seen to fear.
Half unarrayed he ran to his relief,
So hasty and so artless was his grief:
Approaching greatness met him with her charms
Of power and future state;
But looked so ghastly in a brother's fate,
He shook her from his arms.
Arrived within the mournful room, he saw
A wild distraction, void of awe,
And arbitrary grief unbounded by a law.
God's image, God's anointed, lay
Without motion, pulse, or breath,
A senseless lump of sacred clay,
An image now of death,
Amidst his sad attendants' groans and cries,
The lines of that adored forgiving face,
Distorted from their native grace;
An iron slumber sat on his majestic eyes.
The pious duke—Forbear, audacious muse!
No terms thy feeble art can use
Are able to adorn so vast a woe:
The grief of all the rest like subject-grief did show
His, like a sovereign's, did transcend;
No wife, no brother, such a grief could know,
Nor any name but friend.
III.
O wondrous changes of a fatal scene,
Still varying to the last!
Heaven, though its hard decree was past,
Seemed pointing to a gracious turn again:
And death's uplifted arm arrested in its haste.
Heaven half repented of the doom,
And almost grieved it had foreseen,
What by foresight it willed eternally to come.
Mercy above did hourly plead
For her resemblance here below;
And mild forgiveness intercede
To stop the coming blow.
New miracles approached the ethereal throne,
Such as his wondrous life had oft and lately known,
And urged that still they might be shown.
On earth his pious brother prayed and vowed,
Renouncing greatness at so dear a rate,
Himself defending what he could,
From all the glories of his future fate.
With him the innumerable crowd
Of armed prayers
Knocked at the gates of heaven, and knocked aloud;
The first well-meaning rude petitioners.
All for his life assailed the throne,
All would have bribed the skies by offering up their own.
So great a throng, not heaven itself could bar;
'Twas almost borne by force, as in the giants' war.
The prayers, at least, for his reprieve were heard;
His death, like Hezekiah's, was deferred:
Against the sun the shadow went;
Five days, those five degrees, were lent,
To form our patience, and prepare the event.
The second causes took the swift command,
The medicinal head, the ready hand,
All eager to perform their part;
All but eternal doom was conquered by their art:
Once more the fleeting soul came back
To inspire the mortal frame;
And in the body took a doubtful stand,
Doubtful and hovering, like expiring flame,
That mounts and falls by turns, and trembles o'er the brand.
IV.
The joyful short-lived news soon spread around,
Took the same train, the same impetuous bound:
The drooping town in smiles again was drest,
Gladness in every face exprest,
Their eyes before their tongues confest.
Men met each other with erected look,
The steps were higher that they took;
Friends to congratulate their friends made haste,
And long inveterate foes saluted as they passed.
Above the rest heroic James appeared,
Exalted more, because he more had feared.
His manly heart, whose noble pride
Was still above
Dissembled hate, or varnished love,
Its more than common transport could not hide;
But like an eagre rode in triumph o'er the tide.
Thus, in alternate course,
The tyrant passions, hope and fear,
Did in extremes appear,
And flashed upon the soul with equal force.
Thus, at half ebb, a rolling sea
Returns, and wins upon the shore;
The watery herd, affrighted at the roar,
Rest on their fins awhile, and stay,
Then backward take their wondering way:
The prophet wonders more than they,
At prodigies but rarely seen before,
And cries,—“A king must fall, or kingdoms change their sway.”
Such were our counter-tides at land, and so
Presaging of the fatal blow,
In their prodigious ebb and flow.
The royal soul, that, like the labouring moon,
By charms of art was hurried down,
Forced with regret to leave her native sphere,
Came but a while on liking here,
Soon weary of the painful strife,
And made but faint essays of life:
An evening light
Soon shut in night;
A strong distemper, and a weak relief,
Short intervals of joy, and long returns of grief.
V.
The sons of art all med'cines tried,
And every noble remedy applied;
With emulation each essayed
His utmost skill; nay, more, they prayed:
Never was losing game with better conduct played.
Death never won a stake with greater toil,
Nor e'er was fate so near a foil:
But, like a fortress on a rock,
The impregnable disease their vain attempts did mock;
They mined it near, they battered from afar
With all the cannon of the medicinal war;
No gentle means could be essayed,
'Twas beyond parley when the siege was laid.
The extremest ways they first ordain,
Prescribing such intolerable pain,
As none but Cæsar could sustain:
Undaunted Cæsar underwent
The malice of their art, nor bent
Beneath whate'er their pious rigour could invent.
In five such days he suffered more
Than any suffered in his reign before;
More, infinitely more, than he
Against the worst of rebels could decree,
A traitor, or twice pardoned enemy.
Now art was tired without success,
No racks could make the stubborn malady confess.
The vain insurancers of life,
And he who most performed, and promised less,
Even Short himself, forsook the unequal strife.
Death and despair was in their looks,
No longer they consult their memories or books;
Like helpless friends, who view from shore
The labouring ship, and hear the tempest roar;
So stood they with their arms across,
Not to assist, but to deplore
The inevitable loss.
VI.
Death was denounced; that frightful sound
Which even the best can hardly bear;
He took the summons void of fear,
And unconcernedly cast his eyes around,
As if to find and dare the grisly challenger.
What death could do he lately tried,
When in four days he more than died.
The same assurance all his words did grace;
The same majestic mildness held its place;
Nor lost the monarch in his dying face.
Intrepid, pious, merciful, and brave,
He looked as when he conquered and forgave.
VII.
As if some angel had been sent
To lengthen out his government,
And to foretell as many years again,
As he had numbered in his happy reign;
So cheerfully he took the doom
Of his departing breath,
Nor shrunk nor stept aside for death;
But, with unaltered pace, kept on,
Providing for events to come,
When he resigned the throne.
Still he maintained his kingly state,
And grew familiar with his fate.
Kind, good, and gracious, to the last,
On all he loved before his dying beams he cast:
Oh truly good, and truly great,
For glorious as he rose, benignly so he set!
All that on earth he held most dear,
He recommended to his care,
To whom both heaven
The right had given,
And his own love bequeathed supreme command:
He took and prest that ever-loyal hand,
Which could, in peace, secure his reign;
Which could, in wars, his power maintain;
That hand on which no plighted vows were ever vain.
Well, for so great a trust, he chose
A prince, who never disobeyed;
Not when the most severe commands were laid;
Nor want, nor exile, with his duty weighed:
A prince on whom, if heaven its eyes could close,
The welfare of the world it safely might repose.
VIII.
That king, who lived to God's own heart,
Yet less serenely died than he;
Charles left behind no harsh decree,
For schoolmen with laborious art,
To salve from cruelty:
Those, for whom love could no excuses frame,
He graciously forgot to name.
Thus far my muse, though rudely, has designed
Some faint resemblance of his godlike mind;
But neither pen nor pencil can express
The parting brothers' tenderness;
Though that's a term too mean and low;
The blest above a kinder word may know:
But what they did, and what they said,
The monarch who triumphant went,
The militant who staid,
Like painters, when their heightening arts are spent,
I cast into a shade.
That all-forgiving king,
The type of him above,
That inexhausted spring
Of clemency and love,
Himself to his next self accused,
And asked that pardon which he ne'er refused;
For faults not his, for guilt and crimes
Of godless men, and of rebellious times;
For an hard exile, kindly meant,
When his ungrateful country sent
Their best Camillus into banishment,
And forced their sovereign's act, they could not his consent.
Oh how much rather had that injured chief
Repeated all his sufferings past,
Than hear a pardon begged at last,
Which, given, could give the dying no relief!
He bent, he sunk beneath his grief;
His dauntless heart would fain have held
From weeping, but his eyes rebelled.
Perhaps the godlike hero, in his breast,
Disdained, or was ashamed to show,
So weak, so womanish a woe,
Which yet the brother and the friend so plenteously confest.
IX.
Amidst that silent shower, the royal mind
An easy passage found,
And left its sacred earth behind;
Nor murmuring groan expressed, nor labouring sound,
Nor any least tumultuous breath;
Calm was his life, and quiet was his death.
Soft as those gentle whispers were,
In which the Almighty did appear;
By the still voice the prophet knew him there.
That peace which made thy prosperous reign to shine,
That peace thou leav'st to thy imperial line,
That peace, Oh happy shade, be ever thine!
X.
For all those joys thy restoration brought,
For all the miracles it wrought,
For all the healing balm thy mercy poured
Into the nation's bleeding wound,
And care, that after kept it sound,
For numerous blessings yearly showered,
And property with plenty crowned;
For freedom, still maintained alive,
Freedom, which in no other land will thrive,
Freedom, an English subject's sole prerogative,
Without whose charms, even peace would be
But a dull quiet slavery;—
For these, and more, accept our pious praise;
'Tis all the subsidy
The present age can raise,
The rest is charged on late posterity.
Posterity is charged the more,
Because the large abounding store
To them, and to their heirs, is still entailed by thee.
Succession of a long descent,
Which chastely in the channels ran,
And from our demi-gods began,
Equal almost to time in its extent,
Through hazards numberless and great,
Thou hast derived this mighty blessing down,
And fixed the fairest gem that decks the imperial crown:
Not faction, when it shook thy regal seat,
Not senates, insolently loud,
Those echoes of a thoughtless crowd,
Not foreign or domestic treachery,
Could warp thy soul to their unjust decree.
So much thy foes thy manly mind mistook,
Who judged it by the mildness of thy look;
Like a well-tempered sword, it bent at will,
But kept the native toughness of the steel.
XI.
Be true, O Clio, to thy hero's name;
But draw him strictly so,
That all who view the piece may know,
He needs no trappings of fictitious fame.
The load's too weighty; thou may'st choose
Some parts of praise, and some refuse;
Write, that his annals may be thought more lavish than the muse.
In scanty truth thou hast confined
The virtues of a royal mind,
Forgiving, bounteous, humble, just, and kind:
His conversation, wit, and parts,
His knowledge in the noblest useful arts,
Were such, dead authors could not give;
But habitudes of those who live,
Who, lighting him, did greater lights receive:
He drained from all, and all they knew;
His apprehension quick, his judgment true,
That the most learned, with shame, confess
His knowledge more, his reading only less.
XII.
Amidst the peaceful triumphs of his reign,
What wonder, if the kingly beams he shed
Revived the drooping arts again,
If science raised her head,
And soft humanity, that from rebellion fled.
Our isle, indeed, too fruitful was before;
But all uncultivated lay
Out of the solar walk, and heaven's high way;
With rank Geneva weeds run o'er,
And cockle, at the best, amidst the corn it bore:
The royal husbandman appeared,
And ploughed, and sowed, and tilled;
The thorns he rooted out, the rubbish cleared,
And blest the obedient field.
When straight a double harvest rose,
Such as the swarthy Indian mows,
Or happier climates near the Line,
Or paradise manured, and drest by hands divine.
XIII.
As when the new-born phœnix takes his way,
His rich paternal regions to survey,
Of airy choristers a numerous train
Attend his wondrous progress o'er the plain;
So, rising from his father's urn,
So glorious did our Charles return;
The officious muses came along,
A gay harmonious quire, like angels ever young;
The muse, that mourns him now, his happy triumph sung.
Even they could thrive in his auspicious reign;
And such a plenteous crop they bore
Of purest and well-winnowed grain,
As Britain never knew before.
Though little was their hire, and light their gain,
Yet somewhat to their share he threw;
Fed from his hand, they sung and flew,
Like birds of paradise, that lived on morning dew.
Oh never let their lays his name forget!
The pension of a prince's praise is great.
Live then, thou great encourager of arts,
Live ever in our thankful hearts;
Live blest above, almost invoked below;
Live and receive this pious vow,
Our patron once, our guardian angel now!
Thou Fabius of a sinking state,
Who didst by wise delays divert our fate,
When faction like a tempest rose,
In death's most hideous form,
Then art to rage thou didst oppose,
To weather out the storm;
Not quitting thy supreme command,
Thou heldst the rudder with a steady hand,
Till safely on the shore the bark did land;
The bark, that all our blessings brought,
Charged with thyself and James, a doubly-royal fraught.
XIV.
Oh frail estate of human things,
And slippery hopes below!
Now to our cost your emptiness we know;
For 'tis a lesson dearly bought,
Assurance here is never to be sought.
The best, and best beloved of kings,
And best deserving to be so,
When scarce he had escaped the fatal blow
Of faction and conspiracy,
Death did his promised hopes destroy;
He toiled, he gained, but lived not to enjoy.
What mists of Providence are these
Through which we cannot see!
So saints, by supernatural power set free,
Are left at last in martyrdom to die;
Such is the end of oft-repeated miracles.—
Forgive me, heaven, that impious thought,
'Twas grief for Charles, to madness wrought,
That questioned thy supreme decree!
Thou didst his gracious reign prolong,
Even in thy saints' and angels' wrong,
His fellow-citizens of immortality:
For twelve long years of exile borne,
Twice twelve we numbered since his blest return:
So strictly wert thou just to pay,
Even to the driblet of a day.
Yet still we murmur, and complain
The quails and manna should no longer rain:
Those miracles 'twas needless to renew;
The chosen flock has now the promised land in view.
XV.
A warlike prince ascends the regal state,
A prince long exercised by fate:
Long may he keep, though he obtains it late!
Heroes in heaven's peculiar mould are cast;
They, and their poets, are not formed in haste;
Man was the first in God's design, and man was made the last.
False heroes, made by flattery so,
Heaven can strike out, like sparkles, at a blow;
But ere a prince is to perfection brought,
He costs Omnipotence a second thought.
With toil and sweat,
With hardening cold, and forming heat,
The Cyclops did their strokes repeat,
Before the impenetrable shield was wrought.
It looks as if the Maker would not own
The noble work for his,
Before 'twas tried and found a master-piece.
XVI.
View then a monarch ripened for a throne.
Alcides thus his race began,
O'er infancy he swiftly ran;
The future god at first was more than man:
Dangers and toils, and Juno's hate,
Even o'er his cradle lay in wait,
And there he grappled first with fate;
In his young hands the hissing snakes he prest,
So early was the Deity confest;
Thus, by degrees, he rose to Jove's imperial seat;
Thus difficulties prove a soul legitimately great.
Like his, our hero's infancy was tried;
Betimes the furies did their snakes provide,
And to his infant arms oppose
His father's rebels, and his brother's foes;
The more opprest, the higher still he rose.
Those were the preludes of his fate,
That formed his manhood, to subdue
The hydra of the many-headed hissing crew.
XVII.
As after Numa's peaceful reign,
The martial Ancus did the sceptre wield,
Furbished the rusty sword again,
Resumed the long-forgotten shield,
And led the Latins to the dusty field;
So James the drowsy genius wakes
Of Britain long entranced in charms,
Restiff and slumbering on its arms;
'Tis roused, and, with a new-strung nerve, the spear already shakes.
No neighing of the warrior steeds,
No drum, or louder trumpet, needs
To inspire the coward, warm the cold;
His voice, his sole appearance, makes them bold.
Gaul and Batavia dread the impending blow;
Too well the vigour of that arm they know;
They lick the dust, and crouch beneath their fatal foe.
Long may they fear this awful prince,
And not provoke his lingering sword;
Peace is their only sure defence,
Their best security his word.
In all the changes of his doubtful state,
His truth, like heaven's, was kept inviolate;
For him to promise is to make it fate.
His valour can triumph o'er land and main;
With broken oaths his fame he will not stain;
With conquest basely bought, and with inglorious gain.
XVIII.
For once, O heaven, unfold thy adamantine book;
And let his wondering senate see,
If not thy firm immutable decree,
At least the second page of strong contingency,
Such as consists with wills, originally free.
Let them with glad amazement look
On what their happiness may be;
Let them not still be obstinately blind,
Still to divert the good thou hast designed,
Or, with malignant penury,
To starve the royal virtues of his mind.
Faith is a Christian's and a subject's test;
Oh give them to believe, and they are surely blest.
They do; and with a distant view I see
The amended vows of English loyalty;
And all beyond that object, there appears
The long retinue of a prosperous reign,
A series of successful years,
In orderly array, a martial, manly train.
Behold e'en the remoter shores,
A conquering navy proudly spread;
The British cannon formidably roars,
While, starting from his oozy bed,
The asserted Ocean rears his reverend head,
To view and recognise his ancient lord again;
And with a willing hand, restores
The fasces of the main.
Рояль, будильник, телефон
Заткнутся  к черту.
Псу сахарную косточку кидай.
Гробовщиков, продавших гроб,
Хвали и одари рублем.
Аэроплан на небе
Пусть разгонит облака.
И струи выхлопного газа
Чертят - МЕРТВ ОН.
На шеях  голубей плакаты
Пусть сообщают новость ВСЕМ.
Дорожный полисмен,
Следящий за порядком на шоссе,
Оденет  черные перчатки.
Он был как компас.
Мне показывал
На север, юг,
На запад, на восток.
Руководил в рабочие часы,
И управлял прогулкой
По субботам.
Я думал это вечно
Будет продолжаться.
Теперь ни звезд, ни лун,
Ни света солнца не хочу.
Теперь осталось
Океану высыхать.
И некому в лесу
Кострище шуровать.
Теперь добра не сыщешь.
W.H. Auden
Funeral Blues
- 1 -
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public
doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.
The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.
For nothing now can ever come to any good.
18th November 1852
“VICTORY!”
So once more the cry must be.
Duteous mourning we fulfil
In God's name; but by God's will,
Doubt not, the last word is still
“Victory!”
Funeral,
In the music round this pall,
Solemn grief yields earth to earth;
But what tones of solemn mirth
In the pageant of new birth
Rise and fall?
For indeed,
If our eyes were openèd,
Who shall say what escort floats
Here, which breath nor gleam denotes,—
Fiery horses, chariots
Fire-footed?
Trumpeter,
Even thy call he may not hear;
Long-known voice for ever past,
Till with one more trumpet-blast
God's assuring word at last
Reach his ear.
Multitude,
Hold your breath in reverent mood:
For while earth's whole kindred stand
Mute even thus on either hand,
This soul's labour shall be scann'd
And found good.
Cherubim,
Lift ye not even now your hymn?
Lo! once lent for human lack,
Michael's sword is rendered back.
Thrills not now the starry track,
Seraphim?
Gabriel,
Since the gift of thine “All hail!”
Out of Heaven no time hath brought
Gift with fuller blessing fraught
Than the peace which this man wrought
Passing well.
Be no word
Raised of bloodshed Christ-abhorr'd.
Say: “'Twas thus in His decrees
Who Himself, the Prince of Peace,
For His harvest's high increase
Sent a sword.”
Veterans,
He by whom the neck of France
Then was given unto your heel,
Timely sought, may lend as well
To your sons his terrible
Countenance.
Waterloo!
As the last grave must renew,
Ere fresh death, the banshee-strain,—
So methinks upon thy plain
Falls some presage in the rain,
In the dew.
And O thou,
Watching, with an exile's brow
Unappeased, o'er death's dumb flood:—
Lo! the saving strength of God
In some new heart's English blood
Slumbers now.
Emperor,
Is this all thy work was for?—
Thus to see thy self-sought aim,
Yea thy titles, yea thy name,
In another's shame, to shame
Bandied o'er?
Thy great work is but begun.
With quick seed his end is rife
Whose long tale of conquering strife
Shows no triumph like his life
Lost and won.
sitting alone with nowhere to go
ignoring the static from the radio
that interrupts my favorite song
haven’t loved it in so long
some say love is a foolish thing
and although not in all cases
i can’t help but agree
with the smarter majority
so many weddings
just white funerals
a hand to hold
for the rest of her life
open to the bliss
and the carelessness
be careful, more careful
does it still feel right
i’ll apologize in all the places
where i frowned at all the smiling faces
i just wonder if that will be me
with a wedding dress and a history
so much thought in an august moment
i’m living in my favorite season
but winter’s here, and taking control
as we let the rest of our days unfold
so many weddings
just white funerals
someone she barely knows
becomes her life
open to neglect
and disrespect
that comes with the one
she loved last night
i think of someone i know
better than anyone
i think i’ll be more optomistic
when this is done
can’t help but to think
that my white funeral
won’t be a funeral at all
because i know him
she doesn’t know him
so many weddings
just white funerals
but i’m so glad
that won’t be mine
open to his
fuffilled promises
he knows who i am
we’ll be fine
the white funeral is over
the bride’s been burried
in her own mistake
Thou too art dead, ---! very kind
Hast thou been to me in my childish days,
Thou best good creature. I have not forgot
How thou didst love thy Charles, when he was yet
A prating school-boy: I have not forgot
The busy joy on that important day,
When, child-like, the poor wanderer was content
To leave the bosom of parental love,
His childhood's play-place, and his early home,
For the rude fosterings of a stranger's hand,
Hard uncouth tasks, and school-boy's scanty fare.
How did thine eye peruse him round and round,
And hardly know him in his yellow coats[1],
Red leathern belt, and gown of russet blue!
Farewell, good aunt!
Go thou, and occupy the same grave-bed
Where the dead mother lies.
Oh my dear mother, oh thou dear dead saint!
Where's now that placid face, where oft hath sat
A mother's smile, to think her son should thrive
In this bad world, when she was dead and gone;
And where a tear hath sat (take shame, O son!)
When that same child has prov'd himself unkind.
One parent yet is left-a wretched thing,
A sad survivor of his buried wife,
A palsy-smitten, childish, old, old man,
A semblance most forlorn of what he was,
A merry cheerful man. A merrier man,
A man more apt to frame matter for mirth,
Mad jokes, and anticks for a Christmas eve;
Making life social, and the laggard time
To move on nimbly, never yet did cheer
The little circle of domestic friends.

robot - at least
I used to be a funny human being
Beautifully
you enter the room
Everyone turns
to absorb the splendour
of you.
Your angelic way
shines, as you lower
your chin and smile.
Flawless eyes
like diamonds keep
the room mesmerised
filling their
hearts with smiles.
Your long
flowing brunette
hair, as if touched
by the hands
of angels
caresses the beauty
of your soft neck.
A sweet aroma
floods our senses
to the very perfume
of you.
Elegantly, you
glide over the room
as if carried
by the hands
of God.
You gaze into
my eyes with your
arms out wide
and reward me
with the kindness
of your beautiful
soul, and so romantically
say.
Here, eat your bloody
dinner before it
gets cold.

Oldie is dreamy
Really it is funny
Sun may not have remained sunny
It might have been witnessed by you and not by many
It might have come out from west
You might have gone for its test
Your may be searching for the rest
You prove to be dreamer and try for best
We see so many irrelevant things
It certainly to do something
The chain of thoughts goes on continuously
It is useless thinking if we admit honestly
We can’t base our plan on dreamy side
The reality and fact may remain open very wide
It may have pleasant side in the isolation
It has nothing to do with facts or relation
Still it is nice resort
We have so many comforts
Things move on as per our wish
The end has got very nice finish
Why it makes you so much happy?
You find beautiful girls to marry?
The sun doesn’t get set at all
It is always pleasant and happy call
Reveal it not for even for amusement
You may invite adverse comments
For you it may be fine moment
Enjoy it to self and make good movement
all the money
to the last penny
was found to be proxy
in that country
all essentials
should be freely available
the governance ordered
which brought in this disorder
who does not have a need
for the essentials
right from the cop to the thief
had a need for it that day
opened stores were looted
closed one's were broke open
hand in glove were they
the cop and the thief
a commotion in town
every law broken
the temples barren
even the priest lost his calm
a situation which would not calm down
the governing body had almost broke down
a let loose situation for the hooligans
WHO DOES NOT HAVE A NEED FOR ESSENTIALS
GOD INTERVENED
A FUNNY SITUATION DEMANDED...
A SUPER POWER'S INTERVENTION
AN EARTH QUAKE ROCKED THE TOWN
ALL LOOTERS WERE DRIVEN OUT OF STORES
TO SEE MAN MADE ESSENTIALS CRUMBLE
LIFE THE MOST ESSENTIAL
Welcome to the Colosseum
Where pain is pleasure and it is our pleasure to be of service
Lay back on the rack
The waxing poetics are hot and the iced humor is very dry
The fence sitter splinters are sharp but the elitist tongues are sharper
There are many painful pleasures which abound
We guarantee your total satisfaction
Or we'll give you fifty lashes of your back for free
For no one ever enters with a smile
Who doesn't leave here with a grimace
(2007)
There once was a sister,
who loved to kiss her mister.
Til' one day she came home,
and saw her mister with her sister.
The funny thing is, he would still be here,
If he just wouldn't of kissed her.
Boy I sure am glad I was not her sister!
But even more so that I got to MEET her mister!
In the good old system,
It was the usual custom,
Where teachers lived,
Their students stayed.
The students, beside studies,
Did teachers' household duties,
Be it any work indoor,
Or it was an errand outdoor.
Once, ten students brainless,
Joined a teacher useless,
In a remote village house,
Under the care of his spouse.
They watched one day,
A red hot spoon, the lady
Dropped in a water pool,
For the spoon to cool.
When one of them got fever,
The rest poured cold water,
To cool him down, instead,
Fever raised hot and red.
The ten, once, crossed a river,
And to check up the number,
One stood outside the line,
And the rest formed the line.
The man outside counted nine,
And searched for the tenth one.
Every one did the same, in turn
Found they were short by one.
An old man heard their cry,
To help the fools free from shy,
Asked them to stand in line,
And counted right all the ten.
'A sewing needle, get
Me from the market, '
So ordered the Spouse
Of their master's house.
Four of them went out,
And a needle they bought,
But how it should be carried,
They disputed and argued.
A plantain tree they cut,
At the center pinned it,
And carried the tree home,
With mouth full of foam.
The lady chided them all,
And picked up the needle,
Cursing her ruling stars,
That brought her such fools.
Damn the skirt that had me fell.
Never drool at bawdy damsels,
have a way with magic spells.
Turn you topsy and do pell-mell.
Darn, twisted foot that had me bent.
Showed my behind, a strategic rent.
Blithely swaying, her hand she lent.
In a hoarse report my airs were vent.
Poof! She mocked'n touched her lips.
Shifted weight to jiggle her hips.
Looked I up in an awkward gaze.
Allowed my self a feigned daze.
Hush I gawked at the straining zips.
Torso taut and wow! Jutting tips.
Saw me feast and tossed her head.
Woosh! There went, a tangle of red.
Silence fell as everyone looked.
Oh me gosh, now she's booked.
Mere stubble, on a balding crop.
Without her wig, what a flop!
Devious eyed, I eased my ‘self'
So did, all the gnomes and elf!
By this time, the crowd was near.
Shifty eyes now showed her fear.
Amid loud hoots and raunchy jeers.
Leather boots and bubbling beers.
Woe be gone and half in tears.
Stomped her feet and showed her rear.

Its simply the best.
Chemistry's betther than all the rest
Cause Mrs Rowen treats us the best.
Let's lay her in the ground and put her to rest.
We buried her deep and dark
She was left buck naked in the park.
We buried her chemistry book with her, so never again could she say she was right.
We had left her in the pitch black of the night.
We shall hear her voice 'girls are you following the book'
'yes miss' we reply and give her an evil look.
If you double the pressure, the volume will half.
We stuck the cross int he dirt and had a good laugh.
P1/T1=P2/T2 how is this going to help me decide what occupation to do?
We dug her up just for one last look.
But we found her reading theat bloody chemistry book.
Her mouth was open,
Her mouth was in a wiry grin
We could tell by her breath that she'd been drinking gin.
We stole her book and closed the coffin lid.
We buried her deeper, oh yes we did.
Our cross still stands.
Your'e a champ if you know Boyles law.
It will give you a top grade in the HSC for sure.
She once was an OK teacher
But now shes nothing but a chemistry preacher.
Dreams of her smiling down upon us asking 'where are you up to? '
I know whats going through her mind
What is the next chemical she adds to her deadly brew.
Na Chmistry hoti na main Student hota
Na yeah Lab hoti Na Yeah Accident Hota
Abhi Practical main ayee nazar Ek Larki
Sundar thi Naak Us ki Test Tube Jaisi
Batoon main Us ki Glucose ki Mithas thi
Sansoon main Eter ki Khushboo bhi sath thi
Ankhoon se jhalakta tha kuch is Tarah ka Payar
Bin Piye hi ho jata Tha Alcohol ka Khumar
Benzene sa hota tha Uski Presence ka Ehsas
Andhere main hota tha Radium ka Abhas
Nazrain milien, reaction huwa
Kuch is tarah Love ka Production huwa
Lagne lagay Us ke Ghar ke Chakar aisay
Nucleus ke charon taraf Electron hoon jaisay
Us din hamaray Test ka Confirmation huwa
Jab us ke dady se hamara Introduction huwa
Sun kar hamari baat wo aisay Uchal pare
Ignesium Tube main jaise Sodium Bharak uthe
Wo bole, Hosh main aao, Pahchano apni Auwqat
Iron mil nahin sakta kabhi Gold ke saath
Ye sun ker Tuta hamaray Armanoon Bhara Beaker
Aur hum Chup rahay Benzeldehyde ka Karwa Ghoont pee ker
Ab us ki yadoon ke siwa hamara Kam chalta na tha
Aur Lab main hamaray Dil ke siwa kuch jalta na tha
Zindagi ho gaye Unsaturated Hydrocarbon ki Tarah
Aur hum phirte hain Awara Hydrogen ki Tarah.
I didn't chop my fingers.
They're just short and pink and fat.
I didn't chop my fingers
when I went CHOP, CHOP, like that!
I didn't chop my fingers
when I climbed up on the chair.
I've still got ALL my fingers,
and there's NO blood, ANYWHERE.
YOU might chop your fingers
if you play with Grandma's knife.
Just don't go in Grandma's kitchen,
if you want a peaceful life.
Grandma keeps the gate shut.
She won't even let you SEE,
all the poison in her cupboards,
and hot things for cooking tea.
She's got knives and forks and scissors, AND electric plug in toys.
And I'm not allowed to have them, 'cause I'm just a LITTLE boy.
When I get much bigger,
life won't be such a bore.
I'll have knives and forks and scissors,
AND a HUGE chainsaw.
Down on the Funny Farm
where some say I was born
where laughter is the key
that trips a smile
to whoever visits there.
There is no time
to feel moody or forlorn,
not with a crazy sod like me around.
Howls of laughter echo
from every room.
Now even the animals
have joined in the game
at our home the Funny Farm,
the place some say I was born.
sometimes busy is good usually
I have very busy been recently
busy exposing my funny side
as I get older my funny side
becomes more obvious irretrievably

hei, hei, hei, hei,
heih, heih, heih, heih,
who says one, is only one?
One only one and remain only one,
One and one not make eleven,
join to make it, only remain one,
one will always remain only one,
try, try and try, one will remain one
One mixing with one
make it within one,
one minus one will not remain one;
life is zero without only one,
Even God is one, add no more one,
Add more and more, may not look even,
Christ is one, Allah is one,
They represent one. Mighty only one,
Heaven is one, hell also one,
universe is one and earth also one,
Good is one and bad also one,
kind may be different but meaning only one
What is continent and what is region?
Who is African and who is Asian?
What is Chilean and what is Nigerian?
Someone may come and say I am Serbian,
Not all religions but only human one,
Love them all and hate no one,
reject no one and extend embrace,
No love and hate but smiling only face
I continue to bow,
Lye always low,
Love to man and woman,
Oh, God, show me only one
Love and hate can’t ever one,
sorrow and joy also not one,
poles remain apart and not called one,
Only HE may appear omni and look only one
I need to ask a question
While I'm sitting here alone
Why on earth did someone name
The elbow, Funny Bone?
Ev'ry time I bang it
The last thing on my mind
Is laughing out in ecstasy,
And shouting something kind
Instead I want to lash out
And jump and scream and curse
The pain runs through my body
Only toothache could be worse.
So if you are a specialist
Please do your best to serve
A clumsy man who's sat in pain
I've banged my Ulnar nerve.
it's funny how hello is always accompanied with goodbye
it's funny how good memories can start to make you cry
it's funny how forever never seems to last
it's funny how much you'd lose if you forgot about your past
it's funny how “friends” can just leave when you are down
it's funny how when you need someone they never are around
it's funny how people change and think they're so much better
it's funny how many lies are packed into one “love letter”
it's funny how one night can contain so much regret
it's funny how you can forgive but not forget
it's funny how ironic life turns out to be
but the funniest part of all, is none of thats funny to me
I didn't write this poem, but think its AWESOME! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Its funny how hello is always followed with goodbye,

Funny am I
How at this point of my life
That I'll ever see such as these
That people find it humorous
Of which I don't, at least, not as much
To live a life of folly.
Funny is it
How this world evolve with things
Looking real when everyone knows
That it isn't all there is to it
Wanting 'em with their life at stake
Wishing like nothing in carelessness.
Funny, but not so funny
For people could think as such
Like no one will know of it;
For people could do as such
Like there is no a payback for it;
Funny, but not so funny.
Funny, but not so funny
When such a time comes
As the world evolves
So is what have been sown
May not be at your lifetime
But to the lives of the generation to come.
Funny, but not so funny
When given a time to live
But only not many have the thought of it
Living a life just to get by
Is not what accounted for
But living under the will of God.
Funny, but not so funny... at least, not just yet.
Its funny how hello is alway accompanied with goodbye,
Its funny how good memories can start to make you cry.
Its funny how forever never really seems to last,
Its funny how much you'd lose if you forgot about your past.
Its funny how 'friends' can just leave you when your down,
Its funny how when you need someone their never around.
Its funny how people change and think they're so much better,
Its funny how many lies can be packed into one 'love letter'.
Its funny how people forgive even though they cant forget,
Its funny how one night can contain so much regret.
Its funny how ironic life turns out to be,
But the funniest part of all...
Is that none of thats funny to me
exhaustion fell on this dread,
like mold on these piano keys,
it stunk up the place, still i had
to investigate this electrical
storm, untill i at least isolate
this despondent dyke from killing
itself, and she cries becouse the
cows have no milk,
or the chords have no sound,
or this rain provides no drink.
Sisters and brothers you belong together
Although you pray, mostly you play
To teach, to reach, to fetch one another
Even when your love groove you delay.
Together you sit, you eat, you study
You talk to them and you poke fun
At your mom who's your bosom buddy
And dear pop likes your witty pun.
Sometimes family irritates you stacks
Your fashion, your tuition they select
To pass on wisdom with love packs
When wrong choice you're about to elect.
Whatever the mood is in your cosy family
They mean well in all they choose to do;
Celebrating you or reading you riot homily
They love you. They do care, your home crew.
Once, there was a white cat
Who was really, really fat
So fat
She looked like a bat
Who has eaten a huge rat.
The cat was walking in the street
Following a beat, with her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tictactictactictac
Looking for anything to eat
Milk, fish, tuna, meat...
But what a pity
The street was empty
So empty
Not even a birdie
To make her get nasty.
The cat kept walking in the street
Following a beat, with her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Looking for somewhere to sleep
Bed'n'sheets? Get real! Just a seat...
But she didn't find any, what a shame
Because she was really lame
So lame
She had forgotten her own name
And from where she originally came.
So she kept walking in the street
Feeling the heat, and pain in her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tic,              tac
Looking for someone to blame
Same situation, same game...
Then, the white cat
Saw a tiny red hat
One hat
She ran, jumped and sat
In it, what a lucky cat!
But since she was really fat
She got stuck in the hat
So stuck
She looked like a rat
In a cheese trap.
A dog came walking in the street
Following a beat, with his feet
Tic, tac, tictac
Tic, tac, tictac
He saw something red
So he stopped near the cat's head:
'Haha! Cat, you pay the fees
For acting so bad with your peers! '
'Help, please'
'Call me bad boy, I love to tease
I'm getting outta here, say cheers! '
Then a bird came flying in the street
With his wings, following a beat
Tictactictactictac
Tictactictactictac< br>He saw something red
So he stopped above the cat's head:
'Oh, poor white cat
Are you trapped in this hat? '
'Damn I am! '
'Let me help you, sad little cat
Here, you're out, care for a chat? '
Rumors I heard
Say the cat ate the bird.
I used to complain
About my big funny looking feet
And a friend said,
“Hey they were made that way,
Because when you are sad
And hanging your head low
They give you something
To smile at.”
I bought a piece yesternight
A shining paperweight
I floated it in water
To find it drowned next day!
Weighty wee bit it might be,
But glad to see it sunk
To bottom heart
Where it should have been
Rest In Peace always!
05 08 08
Friend
You and I are friends
You laugh, I laugh
You cry, I cry
You scream, I scream
You run, I run
You jump, I jump
You jump off a
bridge, I'm going to
miss you buddy :)
Would you like life to be a movie?
Which film would you choose?
Which character would you play?
Happy ending or tragedy...
Comedy, drama, parody?
Sally in that restaurant scene?
Cleopatra, the Egyptian Queen
Catherine hauntingly seeking Heathcliffe
Holly Go-Lightly crumbling quietly
Or Thelma and Louise....
Would you always find your heart
In this movie with a classic start
Would the girl get her man,
Would the goodies always win
Or would poignancy hit on the chin?
Would the script be a mirror?
Would you invite your friends for dinner
To see your life on the screen
Creating its own scenes, sets and dreams
Or would you keep it for a private viewing?
Carousel, South Pacific, Showboat.
Gone with the Wind, Oh Scarlet..!
From Here to Eternity, wrestling in the sea
Love is a foundation for these films
Love will take the Oscar every time
Oh what money there is to be made
From love and shattered hopes and dreams
Directors cruelly playing to our hearts
We identify with everyone it seems...
But real life is not a contrived play
The music doesn't intervene magically
To create that perfect kiss, you never
Look like Audrey, or Elizabeth, or Marilyn
First thing in the morning....
The roses don't bloom spontaneously in time
The doorbell doesn't chime when you need it
Bouquets don't wait on your desk
His arms don't circle your waist whilst
You prepare dinner and wash dirty nappies
The diamond doesn't hide in your oyster
The stars don't collide with the moon
Fireworks don't fill the sky with colour
A symphony doesn't play in the background
Why do they deceive us so...
These 90 minute love affairs with life?
We lose ourselves in their wonderment
Close our eyes and silently scream
'Why doesn't that happen to me'.
Why can't I feel like a Pretty Woman
Where is my Knight in Shining Armour
Cruel things. Messing with our dreams
Making us discontent. Mm, what part will I play
Who will I be today? Which strong woman
Which one that gets their cake and eats it?
Which lady in rapturous love shall I be?
Lizzie waiting for her D'Arcy
Sandy in black leather for Danny
Match-maker Emma finding Mr Knightley
Juliet bereft over Romeo, but wait!
The looking glass tells me, it's just me
Seems everyone just hates to see me change
But my brain feels maimed with no ambition of fame
Just money and its funny all I want is that and my honey
Coz the rest are all dummies and I can’t get chummy
With new people who are feeble, fake, and evil
And old friends who crossed me are no longer equals
So i'm use to standing alone prone to breaking thrones
A war zone is my home and a battling I shall go
No love for my peers not after all these years
I won’t shed a tear to hear u all lost what is dear
Coz u haven’t got a clue on what it means to be true
All u do is front, your lost in an image that isn’t you
Like your all a heard of sheep, your all the same no one is unique
U will never reach the peak with all that rubbish you speak
A petty lil criminal running his mouth like he hard is so pitiful
Taking advice from a prisoner? U idiot that’s why u minimal
Wise up learn from the quiet ones before your freedom is critical
It is funny, isn't it,
how fast one can go
from joy to sorrow
down life's twisty road.
It makes her laugh
even as she cries...
Turn the other cheek
or let love die.
So, he called you a liar,
he says it's true,
no matter what you say
or what you do.
'Tis soul-killing
to suffer so,
to be thought as less
than the truth you know...
Well, time goes on
and another day comes;
feel the soft air, the sweet warm sun
and hold fast to this truth:
that you aren't over; life is far from done.
(9.3.06 - The sun shines for you too, Little Spirit.  You're not finished yet...)

Ball on
Ground...
Kick and play
The player's
Ball was
Un happy...!
Lisener's
Also clap
And play...!
Happy Morning kids, I said
Monday morning sir, they giggled
I too smiled saying good one
They winked saying which one
Then I gazed and asked one
Asked, What is your dream?
Kid, sorry no day dreams
I nodded and asked again
So what’s your night dream?
Kid, to not wet my bed
I asked one more kid
Who is the king of forest?
Kid, the king is King Kong
What about lion? I said
Kid, lion lives in zoo
I asked one cute bud
Why monkeys live on trees?
Kid, all monkeys lost keys
Why donkeys work hard?
Kid, all donkeys work for don
Tell why this hens crow?
Why dogs bark? I asked
Then the bell rang loud
Kids ran saying alarm sound
I too left saying funny kids
Were born, work hard at school, then work
hard for a family. Everything is right or
just about right, then death reaps. Makes
one wonder, about a pulsing heart beat
away from death. Just seems, GOD, in
heaven gives and then takes. All vanities
and lusts of life, appear fools play in the
grand spectrum.

JESUS SAVES
There once was a man named Guss
He really wanted to be famous
So he took off his clothes
and struck a big pose
but everyone just said get away from us
He told us funny Jokes and entertained us when we felt down almost in Tears
Funny men
Knows how to bring our spirits up
Funny Men
Makes our day past away quickly and keeps our minds occupied for a While
Funny Men
Is everybody’s best friend and it is true that laughter is the best Medicine
I want to untwine
my youthful body aches
more pills make it go away
it's mind blowing
intertwining worlds, of hate blood
horror pain and mud
you've become a shadow of yourself
your eyelids shake when your eyes close
yes you are still all alone
you are the endless stars
you are the colors in the sky
you are the sun that finally shun
to remind me another day had just begun
destroy, create, repair,
it's all in the open air
and I'm back again.
Dissect my quivering relapses
before everything collapses.
grassy fields full of frisbees
and dogs, mom and dad
sitting together on a bench
made for one.of baseballs
flying high in the air, and
dear old dad showing how
to catch a  ball before it
hits my head.
Sometimes you get laugh
For something that really funny
Sometimes you could laugh
To something that doesn't intent to be funny
Sometimes you make laugh
Because everybody understand what's funny
Sometimes you laugh alone
Because you are the only one that think it's funny
Sometimes you try to laugh
Just to be looked funny
Sometimes you are forced to laugh
Despite it isn't funny
Sometimes you can't help to laugh
Even though it is not actually funny
we have friends who during a
party ask us
where have we been all these times
what we have been doing
on those spare days
and we answer that
we have been writing poems
and trekking the country for metaphors
and they all laugh while holding their wine glasses
thinking that we are joking
and finding us all
funny
'cheers! we'll drink to that' says a friend
to celebrate those days
when we merely talk about stocks and dividend
When you are in love
And you get abit older
You wish you were forever young
When you are shy
And you get abit bolder
You wish you were forever young
Like the rainbows that follow the rain
My love for you will always be the same
When we both get old and think of love
We wish we were forever young.
Funny you should say,
That the world is spining,
Funny you should say,
That Manchester is winning.
Funny you should say,
That time flies fast,
Funny you should say,
That's all in the past.
Funny you should say,
That death is dawning near,
Funny you should say,
He turned a deaf ear.
Funny you should say,
That life is full of honey,
But for that you need money,
Hmmm... funny.
Funny is laughter
Funny is fun
Funny is healthy
Funny is nice
Funny is amusing
Funny is comical
A pelt of pranks
Above the normal ranks
Is funny when it is on
Yet quite sad when gone

Cry again.
It's funny how you said you loved me, then you left me for someone else.
It's funny how you would talk to me as often as possible, and now you completely ignore me.
It's Funny how whenever I was with you I always felt like I was special, But now I feel like a fool for wasting my time on you.
It's funny how I believed all your lies...
But the truth is it's not funny at all.

Scratch here to read the poem.: D
Here we go, another spell,
tell me can you smell the smell?
bats feet rubarub, salt and gum
scrappings from an elephants bum!
This time i know I'll win
when he drinks my spell for him
add a little eye of rat, sicky glue
stuff from underneath my shoe!
frogs legs, ant wings
bogies too, all these things i cast on you
Stir it stir it, dancing round
boiling caldron on the ground
make it bubble, rubble spit
add a fart that'll do the trick
will he drink it?
hold his nose
please dont make me use the hose!
my bubbling coldron on the ground
dancing bare feet make no sound
my spell will work
this drink he takes
A carton from a wimpy shake
fill right up with spell of mine.
Mouse feet, chicken skin bacon ryn.
swallow it all, you will be mine.
wish this spell I did not make
Wish his heart was mine to take.
There are many funny things
that people take with them,
when they are desperate,
and go into the loo.
My boss the other day
took some long handled grabbers in with her.
I am assuming she took them with her
to help pull up her knickers.
I once found a five hundred-page novel
ever so well read.
I’m thinking the person who left it there
must have brought his bed.
He would have needed it
with that many pages to get through.
The next time you go to the loo
just look around at the funny things
others have left behind
and try to work out
what they wanted them for.
2-3 October 2008
The other day
I woke up feeling low
I tried not to think about you
to stop the inevitable tears that threatened to fall.
Funny things tears, they linger yet do not fall.
That night I got angry
as I walked fron the bus stop to my home
My mood slowly dissipated into sadness
I felt the bloody tears linger
am guessing they showed because some ladies looked at me
gossiped and actually stood to stare
Funny thing tears are, they know no shame.
Yesterday I drunk myself into a stupor
because I couldnt bear the thoughts
the happy memories, the questions.
I smoked because I wanted to burn away my pain
my loneliness, my intense craving to end it all
Funny things tears, they come when you least expect them
Last night I hated you
Hated my intense stupid love for you
Hated that my life was blank without you
I went running, jogging to absolve the pain
to numb myself, but pain is stubborn
I ran for miles but still felt that swift flash.
Funny things tears, they burn.
Today I woke up
ignoring my phone I tried to resist it
to resist the urge to call you,
But I did,
Lunch, drinks, kisses more promises
apologies more excuses
smiling, laughing, forgetting
Funny thing love it forgets the tears easily.
Tonight I sleep soundly
But Tommorow I work and the cycle begins.
Funny things tears sometimes they cleanse you.
Funny things that happen quite often to me,
Like going shopping for slippers, and come home without;
Or go out in a tshirt, but find it's back to front I see,
Am I going crazy,  what's happening should I shout?
Funny things that happen when you go to ring on the phone,
Then sure it's the right number, but a man says I've been here a year;
So you end up finding the man is your neighbor in his home,
So you gasp for an excuse, to get off the line, realizing he's so near.
Funny things that's happened to my dad one day,
He couldn't find his glasses, that were on his nose;
Where did you two put them now, is what he did say,
Even when we tried to show him, he was still full of woes.
Funny things had happened to me a while ago,
When I was engaged, a doctor thought I was a wife;
He had not read the history, if he had it would show,
But we just laughed, another funny story to my life.
345
Funny—to be a Century—
And see the People—going by—
I—should die of the Oddity—
But then—I'm not so staid—as He—
He keeps His Secrets safely—very—
Were He to tell—extremely sorry
This Bashful Globe of Ours would be—
So dainty of Publicity—
She had been a late and only child to parents
already old and set; none of us had ever
wanted to go inside that hushed house
and play with her, her room too neat, doll-crowded.
We did encourage her later, though, to enter
the high school talent contest—after we’d heard
her singing My Funny Valentine in a stall
in the girls’ bathroom, reckoning the boys
would laugh, perhaps find us even prettier
in comparison. Still, we would not have predicted
those wisteria-scaled walls, the one room
we could see from the street with its windows
open year round so that greening vines entered
and birds flew in and out—bad luck, we thought,
bad luck. By then we were members of the ladies’
garden club, the condition of her house
and what had been its garden a monthly
refreshment of disappointment, the most
delectable complaint her parents’ last
Coup de Ville sinking in tangled orchard grass
and filled to the roof—plush front seat and rear—
with paperbacks, fat, redundant romances
she had not quite thrown away—laughable,
we laughed, unphotographable—with wild restraint.
Believe me, I run from dying
I know, it's so dumb, but funny trying
WAR, around me everywhere
SOLDIERS, killing everyday, I swear.
Truly, I have nothing to fear
Because when I look in the mirror
I see myself with no hair
A jock, playing, fakinit, like its there
I know... you hate that, my dear
Made your point of view Claire
Telling me, if I show up, you will run out there
Hiding from me, on your feet, downstairs
Anyway, sweetie, anyway, truly I don't care
Whatever you say honey, you love me
With your smile you illuminate my world
You can't imagine my happy feelings,
whenever I tell you, that, without you,
my life has no meaning at all
I love myself, maybe, but I've loved you before
Knowing in your heart Im not outdoors
Because you love me too and I am sure
I Hope, my life is long, because we are made for it
You are what a man wants from this life and more
I love you, its true and beautiful
So let us live our magic story
All thank to My dear friend Cruz
Funny how the very ones who
say they carry the light, also
bear the responsibility for causing
most of the pain in the world.
Funny how the loudest whiners
are the fanciest diners at the
buffet of humanity.
Funny how the rich are exempt
and the poor breed contempt;
how the nations with the most to give
play the best game of politics
supplying the weaponry that
eventually kills
even their own children.
Funny isn’t it how the world works
with its upside down righteousness
and its lawful in-justice, while
all the best parts of mankind are being
sucked out through the holes in the ozone
or dissolved completely in the furnace of
unrestrained industry, avarice and greed.
It’s a funny world alright;
funny how nobody’s laughing.
GOD MADE STEAK
GOD MADE SNAKES
GOD YOU MADE ALOT OF MISTAKES
GOD MADE COOKIES
GOD MADE MOVIES
GOD YOU ENJOY MAKING DOOKIES
GOD MADE YOU TALL
GOD MADE YOU A WALL
GOD LIKES TO PLAY BASKETBALL
GOD WEARS A PAD
GOD GETS MAD
GOD IS IN LOVE WITH  CHAD
GOD MADE LIGHT
GOD MADE FIGHTS
GOD MADE YOU MISTAMINE
People say there is nothing funnier then laughter
You can even chuckle some long hours after
You laugh at what is sometimes seen
You laugh at things you do not mean
Yet some where in all hilarity
In amongst that crazy parody
Will Someone please tell me, I’ll give you money
What makes laughter, so darn funny!
Why, when you laugh do people laugh too?
Laugh not at things you say or things you do
Its crazy how when nothing’s funny
People laugh and clutch their to tummy
Will anybody tell me? Wouldn’t you? please, sonny
What makes laughter so gosh darn funny!
Yes, What makes laughter so gosh darn FUNNY!
How funny it would be if dreamy I
Should leave one book behind me when I die
And that a book of Law—this silly thing
Just written for the money it will bring.
I do hope, when it's finished, I'll have time
For other books and better spurts of rhyme.
How to make you funny?
And you are always funny,
You hide it and
It  is still funny,
And that makes me laugh.
How to make you serious?
And you can not be serious,
Funny is funny,
And being seriously funny is not that funny,
And you laugh.
How to tell you a joke?
And you are the funniest joke
That makes you more funny and serious
While you are drinking and thinking
At the risk
Of spilling the juice of your lips
At my laugh.
i am funny
i cry upon hearing the pleas
of the goats
transported from the
market to the
slaughterhouse
it is ridiculous
as others think of the
goat meat well spiced
for their next
sumptuous dinner
i am funny
thinking about the mass killing
of natives in the south
as other still think of the gain
on the next delivery of
guns and ammunition
i am not just funny
i am crazy
and they are not ridiculous
they are serious
for wars to come and shall never end
for the violence they create
so they may have all the profits
and gain
reality is not funny
war is a serious business
the government is crazy
worshiping a master
this great puppeteer
In the butterfly
Where's the butter in the fly?
And in the better-half
Is there any better half?
In the firefly
Where's the fire in the fly?
And in the caterpillar
Where to cater the pillar?
In the horsefly,
Where's the horse to fly?
And in the saucepan
Where's sauce in the pan?
In the angelfish
Where's angel in the fish?
And in the goldfish
Is there any gold in the fish?
In the catfish
Where's cat in the fish?
And in the sweetheart,
Is there any sweet in the heart?
In the lime fruit,
Where's lime in the fruit?
And in the jackfruit,
How to jack the fruit?
In the strawberry,
Where's straw in the berry?
And in the gooseberry
Is there any goose in the berry?
In the sandwich,
Where's the sand?
And in the hotdog,
Is there any dog?
In the crowbar
Where's crow in the bar?
And in the bookworm
Is there any book in the worm?
In the paper foolscap
Where's the fool or his cap?
And in the crabgrass
Is there any crab in the grass?
In the cocktail,
Or cockroach,
Or cockpit,
Is there any cock or tail?
In the pineapple
Where's the pine or apple?
And in the chickenpox
Is there any chicken?
In the honeymoon
Is there any honey or moon?
And in the mango
Where should the man go?
In the henpecked
Where's the hen pecked?
Such words how many
Appear to be funny?
I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I had a funny dream,
about a marshmallow ball...
he made me so giggley,
then my skin started to crawl...
that cute little puff,
of sugar and sweet,
was very soon,
a scary little treat..
he grew and he grew,
out popped feet and hands,
and then i woke up crying,
after being eaten by the marshmallow man.....
: '(
im now officially petrified of marshmallows...
I am fuuny

And i don't care
I look funny in my underwear
It's funny that im funny
Thats what i like to be
So lets be funny together
Be funny like me
Many people are involved in a so-called monetary unjust,
With a hoop and a holler, turning a minor into a major fuss,
So, the newest one dollar coin is missing, “In God We Trust, ”
They’re calling the absent phrase a religious and political bust.
Hey, an email and the sender is extremely upset about the lack,
No, “In God We Trust” to the post office she wants to give it back,
A lot of families are hard hit as news programs document the lack,
But when cameras get close we see cigarettes and plenty of Jack.
The respect and use of any countries money has never changed,
Shekel, Denari, Peso, Yen, even solid gold, what’s in a name?
May in church circles will not even bother to pay their 10% tithes,
On that note, does it really matter and if so please elaborate why?
It’s not how much you have but what is done with it that counts,
The old woman put in two copper mites yet it was a greater amount,
Than those who gave plenty more out of their abundant wealth,
And no matter how much money you have it still can’t buy health.
“Silver & gold have I not but in the name of Jesus stand up & walk, ”
Oh yeah, “In God We Trust” was not on currency but in his talk,
Remember the phrase that, “a fool and money his soon will part, ”
Any amount is useless unless it’s written upon the spender’s heart.
Peter fetched a shekel from the mouth of a fish for taxes to pay,
What phrase and whose picture was on money back in the day?
The very best way to deal is by none other than barter and trade,
It is the one and only way to get out the exact amount you paid.
Undercover hit men are hired to kill a spouse yet they wind up in jail,
Rapists and drunks are released on insignificant amounts of bail,
Committing their crimes again, any one have a similar story to tell?
How many people carry money but still lie, cheat and raise hell?
And here’s the strangest situation, I just have to tell you this one,
A minister wanted to use “In God We Trust” money to buy a gun,
Not for the purpose of home protection they already had a target,
Funny! Murder on the mind from a perched position in the pulpit.
Okay! This helps to explain why there is a certain type of attrition,
Bullet manufacturers work 24/7, there’s a shortage of ammunition,
Not enough “In God We Trust” for lunch programs or Head Start,
However, way more than enough to brutally rip each other apart.
Yes, many people see this inscription as being a fresh new start,
“They honor Me with their lips but despise Me with their heart, ”
If “In God We Trust” on money was all that needed to be done,
Then God would never have needed to sacrifice His only Son.
'In God We Trust' was actually passed Into law only as a motto,
Good to know because this makes it even more shallow & hollow,
Teddy Roosevelt said sacrilegious, Supreme Court Would not relent,
So it's, 'lost through rote repetition any significant religious content.'
A very slick imposter hustler slides into ACORN seeking money,
With a hidden camera and his equally fake hooker looking honey,
Just to be sure there was no misunderstanding or optical illusion,
Staff told how to hide “In God We Trust” made from prostitution.
Assuredly, just as sure as Thursday follows Wednesday & without fail,
Before helping another in serious need some woman will do her nails,
And, certainly a priority will arise however if it is not one of their own,
Most people will first tip the driver who brings fried rice to their home.
As many are screaming for assistance their sounds fall on deaf ears,
Closest family and friends are more apt to buy fried chicken and beer,
Without a doubt everyone knows someone who’s in severe dire need,
Just make sure it’s for essentials, not cocaine, heroin, wine or weed.
By the way, it was all just an error on some, a simple mistake,
However, those coins are selling for $50 so they can’t be fake,
Dig this, without the inscription they’re worth a whole lot more,
And so the fact that they have more value might make Him sore.
Today’s currency is used for less good and way too much harm,
Drugs, sex, the black market, fraudulent claims and illegal arms,
The new dollar coin in missing, “In God We Trust” that is so funny,
Think God wants His name on anybody's uncircumcised money?
Isn’t it funny how all of a sudden you care
But when we were together you were never there
Isn’t it funny how to make me jealous you’re with her
But when you see me with him, everything starts to blur
Isn’t it funny how you want me to miss you
But when we were together, other girls you’d pursue
Isn’t it funny how you think of me when you’re alone at night
When im across the street in his arms wrapped up tight
Isn’t it funny how you sit there thinking of me
While im in the sky, completely carefree
Isn’t it funny how much the tables have turned
I hope from all this, SOMETHING, you have learned
Isn't it funny
when people flick their hair and look
down at you, snickering?
hehehe
Isn't it funny
when nature whips its lash and rips
through the sky, thundering?
roarrrrrroarrrr
Isn't it funny
when machines go bezerk and leave
a trail of broken pieces, destructing?
crrraaack
Isn't it funny
when you realize that these things
are not at all funny and
want to bonk yourself on the head?
No, not really. But humans
often find horrible things hilarious
as long as they are not the source of the
Funniness.
Think about it
Isn't it funny?
The world we are living in is just a dream
We are bad
We are doing evil
We waste our time running for money
We waste our time trying to get famous
But we don't see whats real
We don't realize the real person we are
We know the fact yet we don't notice it
Isn't it funny?
You may die tomorrow
Just think
You may die tomorrow
No money
No fame
No fun
No evil
Life's over!
Thats what we don't realize
Nothing is for granted
Not even our life
We may die tomorrow
So be a better man and don't live for life
Be a better man live for the death
You never know when your time comes
You never know when your time's up!
See the mirror
And ask the man in the mirror
Ask him to change himself
I wanna get this message straight
I wanna get this clear
You better change yourself
Maybe the time is near
isn't it funny,
how the world likes to be?
isn't it funny,
how much you don't mean to me?
isn't it funny,
how much i care?
it really isn't funny,
when you're not there.
isn't it funny,
how we used to be?
isn't it interesting,
what you meant to me?
isn't it strange,
how we fell apart?
isn't it great,
we both miss our hearts?
one last thing,
before i throw this ring,
wasn't it funny...
to see what i'd do?
isn't it laughable,
how i still love you?
Its funny how hello is always accompanied with good-bye
Its funny how remembering good memories can make you cry
Its funny how forever never seems to really last
Its funny how much you'd lose if you forgot your past
Its funny how friends can just leave you when you're down
Its funny how when you need someone there never around
Its funny how people can change and think there so much betta
Its funny how many lies can be packed into one love letta
Its funny how people can forgive even tho they cant forget
Its funny how one night can catain of so much regret
Its funny how crazy and ironic life turns out to be
but the funniest part of all is that none of that seems funny to me
it's funny how hello is always finished with goodbye
it's funny how good memories can make you cry
it's funny how forever never seems to last
it's funny how much you would lose if you forgot about your past
it's funny how “friends” can just leave when you are down
it's funny how when you need someone they never are around
it's funny how people change and think they are so much better
it cant be packed in one letter
it's funny how one night can contain so much regret
because the funniest part of all, is none of thats funny to me
Its Funny...
When im happy I have a bad day
Its Funnny,
That when I wish it was hot it snowed
Its Funny,
That when the world is finally at peace War begins
Its Funny,
When I fancy Chicken my mum cooks pork
Its Funny,
When I get a new phone It breaks
Its Funny,
When I tell my friend a secret and politely ask her not to tell a soul but she does anyway
Its Funny,
When my mate does something wrong I get in trouble
Its Funny,
I want to watch a movie on T.V but theres a powercut from start to finish
Its Funny,
When I ask for a cat for my birthday, I get a fish
Its Funny,
When I say I love you
You reply....I love you too and I always will
It's funny how the ones who show you the most love,
Are often the ones who say it the least
It's funny how the ones who tell you they love you the most,
Are often the ones that hurt you the most
It's funny how the ones who beg for forgiveness,
Are often the ones who least deserve it
It's funny how the ones who mess everything up,
Are often the ones who make you feel guilty
It's funny how the ones who are the happiest,
Are often the ones who've known the most heartache
It's funny how those hearts can always mend themselves,
If you give them enough time and space
It's funny how this life just keeps going,
No matter how hard you may beg it to slow down.
You broke my heart
So many times
Was he sweeter?
Is he better?
Was the grass greener?
On the other side?
Wipe your eyes
Please don't cry
You meet a monster
Clever like Dracula
Please don't bother me
I am eating lobster
With my brother
I hate your sorry lines
And the stupid lies
Get another guy
My love bye, bye
Shut the door
I need time to recover
Sorry it's over

I had a little puppy dog,
He was Jully the funny dog,
He did walk and sleep and run with me,
All I had to do was keep him clean.
He was really scared of my cat,
He used to hide under the mat,
He barked a lot when he saw the ants,
He used to rip off my Uncle’s pants.
He hates the cow in the farm,
There’s not one day he didn’t bring down the farm,
The cow was angry with him one time,
That she poked him with her horns and went far aside.
If someone shouted at me once or twice,
He would bark and bark at him more than a thrice,
A chick once he tried to swallow,
But, poor me! He couldn’t do more than a hallow.
When it is bedtime, he slept with me,
The blanket went to him rather than me,
He is good example that barking dogs never bite,
But do remember, his bark is worse than his bite.

For two lovebirds, I met a Stratford on Avon
With the first initials D & T
They know who they are.
Love is a funny thing,
one minute you are up,
then the next you are down.
Then your head is spinning around,
your seeing stars,
dancing on the moon.
Love is a funny thing,
and that is for sure.

There once was an old Irish Setter,
So ugly that no one would pet her,
Then one day she was struck
By a huge garbage truck,
I swear the dog looks so much better.
'Love in vain? '
she whispers to herself.
Laughs.
A pun
at a time
like this.
Smiles.
Winces
...at the pain.
Cuts
...her wrists.
Cuts.
Her.
Wrists.

My daddy’s so funny; always making me laugh
But, he’s the best daddy anybody could have
Every time he comes around he has something funny to say
On days when I feel down daddy can always makes my day
My daddy’s so funny even when he’s not trying to be
He has a way with words and gestures that always tickles me
He makes funny expressions, and he’s so witty too
He’s so funny he’ll make you forget you were feeling blue
My daddy’s so funny, but he is also sweet
He will do anything to help someone else; even get them off the street
You can find him givin’ change, or just standing up talkin’
To a person that most people would look at and just keep on walkin’
My daddy’s so funny, but he is such a good provider
He would do anything to take care of his family, even use the car like a taxi driver
I’ll never forget the time he got up at 5: 00 in the mornin’
He walked me all the way to my train stop, even though it was stormin’
My daddy’s so funny, but helped raise us girls so well
When my mama told us “no, ” we couldn’t run to him and tell
He taught us to be dainty and to act like ladies
He was always involved in our lives from the time that we were babies
My daddy’s so funny, but he takes good care of my mother
No matter how tough times would get, he always stood by her
He has been with her for more than 50 years
With her he has shared much marital bliss and many tears
My daddy’s so funny, but there is something you should know
He might laugh and joke a lot, but he takes life seriously though
His personality and the things he does are not for him to be seen
He just is who he is, and really loves people; from that we can all glean
My daddy’s so funny, when you ask him what he has to give
He’ll tell you in a minute, “I got mo’ cold cash than you got days to live! ”
My daddy is so funny, when I just think about him I laugh
I thank God for my daddy, one of the greatest gifts any girl could have.
Love makes many lose temper
Others get hurt
Some even cry and forget about their existence
Unlike my funny man
He is always happy
Laughing and cracking jokes all the time
Amazing how funny he is
When in trouble he stays calm
He stands still and plans ahead
No time for worries
His presence hinders me from remembering
all snares the world brings
Because of him I refuse to think
the world contains stubborn men
His funny stories never cease
and my happiness will last forever with my funny man
Little by little he is turning me into a funny woman
I can feel the changes in me
There is always a smile on my face
Whenever I talk, he laughs and becomes happier
I know I am his funny woman
What a pleasure to have my funny man around!
The storm seemed
to run out of breath
rested on a roof a bit
and catching me
observing it
gathered itself up
found its second wind
and flew at me
in a fury.
It snatched my hat
and ran off with it
thinking it
was funny.
I didn’t think it was
funny.
It's not funny when
you laugh and call
me names
I don't smile  when
you push me down
and laugh
I don't find it very funny
when you dis me and
say it was just a joke
I'm not the one who  laughs
when you call my name but
turn away
Your jokes  are not funny
and never will be so stop
saying them
It is not only funny
But very astonishing and clumsy
We all know about the holiness of boobs
Holy mention too can be found in books
Women are much more praiseworthy
Some may wear the ugliness gifted from almighty
The deformity and unnatural growth is not in our hands
The body as such will be submerged and  melted at the end
All nourishment and food is catered from that part
Our life gets shape and growth from the very start
Let us adore and praise the ladies for commendable job
We should not denigrate their honor and rob
It may be shown as world record
Many may take it as mere reference for looking forward
Any good looking natural piece deserves to be praised
But wrong way of projection should also be outrightly condemned
It must be taken as deformity in body
It is not done for records by somebody
It is really annoying for its wrong way of presentation
Otherwise it is not even worth for its mention
The opinion and perception may vary
The impression and meaning may also differently carry
Yet the basic concept of giving honor to ladies need not be compromised
Ladies deserve good comments and treatment as consciously promised
I'm thinking of something Funny
And it looks a little Runny
I suppose it could be from someone's Nose
That the person never Blows
I'm thinking of something Funny
Could make your Day a little more Sunny
In Holland they say it rains like Cats and Dogs
But I say it rains like Cows and Hogs
Lets all Say,
A Joke a Day
Keeps the Doc. Away
P.S.
Please write something Funny
And you'll be my Friend, to the End
Well to the end of your Poem :)
Tears come in funny places
when you least expect them too.
All of a sudden the eyes well up
crying out, with sounding vocals of ones, boo-hoo's!
You'll find them sometime appearing
while bidding a loved one, 'ado.'
Some are shed in a moments sadness
they are just that emotions, emotional fuse.
One might try to restrain their tears
from flowing down ones cheeks.
But you will never be able to stop their flow
it might cause you to spring a leak!
Joy, sadness, fear and anger
and from ones laughter, sometimes too!
Tears come in funny places
they can and will happen one day to you!
A server was a man with drinks
A Notebook was where you write
A click was done with fingers
And a reboot means you had a fight
Cyberspace was where the spaceships went
A screen saver was a cinema's bodyguard
Traffic only happened in cars
And Spam always had a lot of lard
Java was a type of bean
Hacking was what an axe-man's job,
A platform was where you sang
And a volley was a type of lob
Scan was to read really fast
A Moniter was a teacher
A shortcut was a dangerous way
And Shout-Outs done by preachers
Meg was the name of my girlfriend,
And gig was a job for the nights.
Now they all mean different things,
And that really mega bytes.
An application was for employment.
A program was a TV show.
A cursor used profanity.
A keyboard was a piano.
Memory was something that you lost with age.
A CD was a bank account.
And if you had a 3 inch floppy,
You hoped nobody would ever find out.
Compress was something you did to the garbage,
Not something you did to a file,
And if you unzipped anything in public
You'd be in jail for a while.
Log on was adding wood to the fire.
Hard drive was a long trip on the road.
A mouse pad was where a mouse lived,
And a backup happened to your commode.
Cut you did with a pocket knife.
Paste you did with glue.
A web was a spider's home,
And a virus was the flu.
I guess I'll stick to my pen and paper,
And the memory in my head.
I hear nobody's been killed in a computer crash,
But when it happens they wish they were dead!
'Twas a Funny Little Fellow
Of the very purest type,
For he had a heart as mellow
As an apple over ripe;
And the brightest little twinkle
When a funny thing occurred,
And the lightest little tinkle
Of a laugh you ever heard!
His smile was like the glitter
Of the sun in tropic lands,
And his talk a sweeter twitter
Than the swallow understands;
Hear him sing--and tell a story--
Snap a joke--ignite a pun,--
'Twas a capture--rapture--glory,
An explosion--all in one!
Though he hadn't any money--
That condiment which tends
To make a fellow 'honey'
For the palate of his friends;--
Sweet simples he compounded--
Sovereign antidotes for sin
Or taint,--a faith unbounded
That his friends were genuine.
He wasn't honored, maybe--
For his songs of praise were slim,--
Yet I never knew a baby
That wouldn't crow for him;
I never knew a mother
But urged a kindly claim
Upon him as a brother,
At the mention of his name.
The sick have ceased their sighing,
And have even found the grace
Of a smile when they were dying
As they looked upon his face;
And I've seen his eyes of laughter
Melt in tears that only ran
As though, swift-dancing after,
Came the Funny Little Man.
He laughed away the sorrow
And he laughed away the gloom
We are all so prone to borrow
From the darkness of the tomb;
And he laughed across the ocean
Of a happy life, and passed,
With a laugh of glad emotion,
Into Paradise at last.
And I think the Angels knew him,
And had gathered to await
His coming, and run to him
Through the widely opened Gate,
With their faces gleaming sunny
For his laughter-loving sake,
And thinking, 'What a funny
Little Angel he will make!'
why do popes wear funny little hats
litlle and round
not to mention funny
sure they serve a purpose
but what? ? ?
You used to say
'Dreams never comes true'
You used to think
'You are just cheating me'
But time speaks by itself
and stronger feelings
can't be hidden so long
Now, I have seen your arm get turned
I have seen your sight changes
Cause now you can't keep blocking the sun
with a single finger
Cause now is too late to block your heart
I am already living there!
You know is truth
You know is reality
No matter time
No matter spaces
No matter how
No matter why...
Cause Love has no rules
Cause Love is law
Love has no limits
Love is an endless power
and change us in his weird way
This is Life
just suddenly changes
Getting us in love
Getting us on pain
Getting us into new learnings
Just getting us
Into his Funny way!
Oxymorons are 2 contradicting words,
Now tell me, isn't that absurd?
An example of this is virtual reality,
Is that possible or just a casual formality?
What about the living dead,
Am I just being a butt head?
Am I leading this into a fine mess?
Isn't this moment priceless?
Don't worry; the poem is nearly done,
I'm just having a bit of serious fun.
Am I truly a big baby?
Well, it's a definite maybe.
Well I'm going to give you a practice test,
Tell me now, who is the second best.
I thank God that I'm an Atheist,
Also thank Him that I am a cautious optimist.
Now I am all alone,
In my office that's also my home.
Eating my very bland spice,
Wasn't this poem awfully nice?
Isn't life funny sometimes?
The ups, the downs,
The smiles, the frowns
The utter beautiful confusion
We find ourselves in?
When doors close and others open
When the rainclouds disperse
And the sunshine warms your face
Rainbows dancing in your garden
But you can't hold that pot of gold?
And then there's love.. love?
What is that? Is it a mutual sharing
A pairing of souls that 'match'
A slow dance in your irises
And a flash of lightning in your heart?
Or is it a cold, harsh thunderstorm
That doesn't abate, that ultimately
Leads to that word, 'hate'?
I don't like that word, really no
Hate isn't something for me
But I enjoy living, and feeling
Even if that feeling is often
Hard and difficult to understand
And faith, when held in your hand
Is so fragile, delicate and pure
This tango of life, this passion
That jumps into my heart and spins
Trips over itself, haunts me
Is all I ever want to feel, to be..
And I am so unashamedly thankful
To everyone that has ever touched me
And made me, Me.. otherwise
What would I be? Just another lost soul
Walking along the road of life
Without ever scuffing their feet
I love that my soles have blisters
And that scars are worn with pride
That this happy, fantastic wonderous ride
Is a journey I'm glad I didn't miss
It is surely, utterly, bliss
he's been waiting for this his whole life...
he's wanted her for a long time...
he's finally going to lose his virginity...
he's dreamed about this for years...
he's been in a daze scince she told him it was tim...
he's bought all the condoms he could buy...
he's waiting impatiently for the time to pass...
he's going to become a man...
(she shows up)
he's almost riping her clothes off...
she's almost riping his clothes off...
they've been goig out for 5 years...
he's been waiting even longer...
he's got it all in a plan...
then she whispers 'i'm a man'
Past times are strange
Sometimes funny
Sometimes sad
The past
Brings change of views
Change of ideas
Change of heart
But sometimes
The wounds of the past
Never heal
Never leave
The past is strange
And doesn’t change
Never
Change
When olive branch, we show the world,
They think, our weakened stage has come,
And treat us worse than ev’n before!
When flag of truce, in hand we hold,
They stiffen conditions on us,
As though we can’t fight anymore!
When bow we as mark of respect,
They look down upon us askance,
As though we are worthless on earth!
The world today is suspicious;
The human lives are less precious;
There’s dearth of people more pious!
Man wants to do whatev’r he likes;
Money decides the things he does;
The love in families seems gone.
One wants to make a quicker buck;
One takes more risks and tries his luck;
One feels things can be got by pluck.
Oh, what a funny world, it seems!
The human face appears well-masked;
The heart of man is ne’er contrite!

Something's wrong with me
Or them
I'm talking the men and women
Who deliver the weather
All of 'em like heat
While I'm a blizzard through and through.
an unceasing  flush
a toddler waving bye-bye,
to toilet papers
Under the ring of linked brown arms,
bare feet, brown feet with whiter soles
drum on the dusty, hard brown earth, stomp the rhythm
as if to wake the gods of earth
to draw the rain down to the roots,
caressing seeds against the growing time,
hearing the tears at the heart of things;
hearing the shuffle-clank
of leg irons listening for some rhythm that consoles
with promise; hearing the blues sung softly, like a prayer,
taken up across the cotton field,
sadness meeting hope in longing patience
and  a century ago
the white lady who loved Africa said,
I am weary with the future
*
white boy, you’re so young –
how could you hear the blues so well?
are they just around the corner
of every town that’s built, as dusk descends?
Do they lurk wherever lips meet plangent trumpet,
in the reeds of mourning clarinet,
the nostalgia of a dreaming saxophone?
Wherever future whispers to the past
and hears the sad reply?
white boy, white boy without a past,
you hear the blues so well,
I think you hear
those future blues,
those old white future blues,
those lonesome future blues.
Everyday is  a new born babe
Holding within its clenched fists
Secrets of a fledgling  future
Fluted down spirals of time
Cast away living in a bubble,
Ir orbit around an endangered earth.
Lost among the skyhawks of futuristic power..
I’m sworn to take an oath.
To move unseen through portholes in chase.
Where eyes of an eagle sore  deep dark space.
I live my life far away from home.
Protected, without fear, in a bubble I roam.
Man crushed the evergreens of earth.
Water contamination, no more rebirth.
I, with a chosen few,
see the earth from a different view.
Why dwell on something
You can not change
Look  to the future
Do the best you can
Ask our Heavenly Father
To give you a helping hand
Written:  Sept.29,2007
In the hustle and bustle of modern day living
A place full of greed and much less forgiving
In back streets and alley's, in dust and decay
A new breed of child reaches out for the day
A child of the future, quick witted and sour
His ambition survival, He lives for the hour
Nobodys child with nowhere to run
Allegiance to no one, and a needle for fun
No one to care if he lives or he die's
No child protection to witness his cries
If this is our future, then there isn't much hope
You know what they say, if you give enough rope
Put a price on the misery, we leave in this world
Small ragged bundles curled up in the cold
Wheres the compassion, Have we no sense of shame!
If we sow fields of sorrow, then expect crops of pain.
I look in the mirror,
and what do I see?
A face with no future,
stares out at me.
On the table, a glass and a bottle,
of my favourite poison.
When I was young,
I drank to be alive.
Now all I do,
is drink to survive.
My eyes bloodshot,
filled with vacant stare.
My face goes unshaven,
but what do I care?
My bottle is now empty,
quickly replace with one full.
Soon it will be empty,
just like this fool.
Family and friends fled.
My eyes were blind.
All they could see,
was another drink,
in front of me.
My legs get unsteady.
I stagger instead of walk.
A bottle wrapped in paper,
gripped tightly by my hand.
My clothes grow dirty,
as days and nights combine.
A smile is frozen,
on this face of mine.
My arm flex out,
when I stumble to the ground.
Faces look down at me,
expressions display my waste.
I just hold my smile,
as I lay there in their midst.
At least my bottle,
didn’t break,
on my fall from grace.
Time for another drink,
raise bottle to my lips.
Liquid trickles down my throat,
and still my smile remains,
as silly as it can be.
The faces disappear.
Everyone has gone now.
Like family and friends,
they all desert.
I lay there on my own.
For no one wants to take,
a drunk home.
25 Jan 2007
I think about the future,
And I wonder about our life.
To much hate for one planet,
To much fear.
Somehow,
I missed the announcement
That love had died,
I missed her funeral,
I hope it was nice.
Lost;
The masses cling to faith,
While the homeless
Cling to paper sacks,
Filled with empty dreams,
Fading, like old yellow newspapers,
In the rain.
In the future,
There will be a day,
When life
Will be worth more than greed;
And paper sacks,
Are just paper sacks.
I hope it comes soon.
Yes, the war for oil
many tempers on the boil
stay on homeland soil.
And soon it happens
that axis evil countries
blow up their neighbours.
It is ordained then
that terror bombs will soon rain
on peaceful people.
And if they do not
the world will wait a decade:
New SUPERPOWER.
Too late then buddies
as billions overcome you
an ugly slaughter.
Before we die though
we will regret decisions
of doing nothing.
A future time, a future place
Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open if you choose
To learn the skills that you can use
Computers you use every day
Atomic medicine is here to stay
A walk on the moon is a thing of the past
We're on our way to the stars at long last
Radar, and laser, and quasar, and such,
These words sound strange, but they mean so much
Learn these things, and many more
See what wonders the world has in store
Don't let folly lead you away
From Learning the skills you need so today
Have fun in your life, but don't learn with sorrow
That the fun of today won't feed you tomorrow
Be good to yourself, and study with zest,
And, soon, you will find you're ahead of the rest
A future time, a future place
Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open, come on through
Learn the skills, it's up to you
We hear it over again
Live for today
For tomorrow
May be the end
Still another day
Comes and goes
What I did with it
Nobody really knows
Tomorrow is
another day
And will be fuller
Come what may
For though the future
Is not mine to predict
Still many more boxes
Waiting to be ticked
Sail fast, sail fast,
Ark of my hopes, Ark of my dreams;
Sweep lordly o'er the drowned Past,
Fly glittering through the sun's strange beams;
Sail fast, sail fast.
Breaths of new buds from off some drying lea
With news about the Future scent the sea:
My brain is beating like the heart of Haste:
I'll loose me a bird upon this Present waste;
Go, trembling song,
And stay not long; oh, stay not long:
Thou'rt only a gray and sober dove,
But thine eye is faith and thy wing is love.
The year is 2285
Everyone is getting high
It’s all about high profile
To live is to die
No more prison and trial
A free world to compile
All your sins will fly
The judgment is yours to consider
Money for nothing to ponder
Distance yourself further
No retreat and no surrender
The going will get wilder
The tough will get weaker
The ozone layer became thinner
The icebergs had landed
Low lying lands became embedded
Like thrusting a knife that is jagged
Seems like most parts are flooded
Highlands are barricaded
Population intakes are limited
To survive is to be restricted
Who’s the poor and who’s the richest?
It’s a taboo to say and yet superstitious
To be in power would be the strongest
Sharing your power could be the longest
To live that long is tremendous
And the poor would become notorious
To be left out as the monotonous
Global warming has taken its toll
It’s not like walking in the park to stroll
The heat could penetrate even your soul
No more south and north pole
Your best next home is in the hole
Behold this day a future will bring.
Snow is quietly gracing the ground.
There will then just be a silent sound.
Will it be one of which we will sing?
Tonight we’ll be skating on the pond.
By the cracking fire we’ll coddle round.
Each and ev’ry one will form a bond.
There will then just be a silent sound.
No recipe is ours to follow
Flitting in the night with the swallows.
Around and around we’ll make a ring.
Perhaps a song or two we will sing.
The ice smooth and glistening will be.
Expecting others with eagerness.
Some happiness there surely will be.
We’ll be snug like birds in a nest.
-March,2008
A toy locomotive
fresh red paint
on it’s wooden boiler
waits on time for completion.
Black and white tints
stands ready in jars
for the peeling
of masking tape.
and a grandmother’s
meticulous brushing.
The little train
In brightest color array
will match another
quilted on a toddler’s comforter.
Nathanael, know that you are richly loved
by the tender body and soul
that once enclosed your mother.
Don’t talk about the past but focus on your future
I would prefer to know about the previous
relationships of the one “my one” and I would
tell him every thing about me.
I think its something that makes
us closer to each other.
Of course I don’t like to know the details
such as how much he loved
her or what he was doing to make
her happy or what ever of these details
because it will not help or do any
good thing to the relationship but
I would ask about how these relationships ended,
why and what he didn’t like about them.....
But after talking about such things
with your partner you shouldn’t be
judgmental and you should never
talk about it again, or listen to any
one else talking to you about it,
or use it against him / her someday
because that would break your partner’s
heart and he/she will never be honest with you again.
Just listen, take what you wanted  to know,
and throw the story behind your back.
Just keep in your mind that it’s the past
and you are your partner’s present and future
and this is the only important thing now and forever.
I personally believe you should give
the second part as much information
as he/she plans to drag out of you.
If one needs to know the name of every
other gender person you talked to,
then squeeze your mind and remember.
If he/she only asks for headlines,
then go ahead and offer them but
spare him/her the details if he/she seems
not wanting to bother him/herself with the
details of a past history.
What I'm trying to say, let the other part decide
how much they want to know, and work accordingly.
10 January 2008
I dreamt that she and I had met
when we were young and fancy free.
It is a dream I shan’t forget
but will remember happily.
We fell in love and we were wed
together raised a family.
I see the pictures in my head.
My dream was Oh so right to me.
It was a dream that could not be.
We did not meet we did not wed
but yet I hold the memory.
Perhaps  allowed to look ahead
See what in time would come to be.
She married but she was betrayed
I wed and raised a brood of three.
A sad mistake which fate had made.
When we were old and fancy free.
We met as we were meant to do
The fates had reversed their decree.
Brought us together and we knew.
That you were meant to be with me
and I was meant to be with you.
Too late to have a family
I am content just finding you.
Perhaps it’s possible to see
some things which haven’t happened yet
That in due course will come to be.
A vivid dream you can’t forget.
Some sort of future memory.
I only know my dream came true
when you agreed to marry me
I had to wait so long for you.
24-Jun-07
the world beyond our shameless eyes
is drowning more than we can see
where money is what cheating buys
but never seems to grow on trees
tomorrow's dreams of yesterday
have dissipated in the heat
of poisons and ozone decay
while houses crumble in the street
our lives drone on repeatedly
toiling toward some unknown end
forlorn attempts die feebly
to fix what time itself can't mend
the government is fraudulent
and slightly skewed toward tyrany
what they say and what they meant
shout greed and mass hypocrisy
and for the future we invest
no questions asked, no answers raised
about the past we joke and jest
yet disregard the present days
but who's to blame, and who's to say?
why should the 'Land of Liberty'
or any other nation pay
for crimes of all humanity?
Future Perfect
Two auld biddies gossiping
aboot their hubbies suffering.
My Albies plagued with aches and pains
Ye knaa he’s got varry close veins..
That’s aaful pet her friend replied.
With eagerness she could not hide

Supping beer he shouldn’t have

Ye knaa hinny but for us

Theres neither of them fit te work
Aah wonder sometimes if the shirk
but we gan on as women dee.
We have nee time to be poorly.
They said Tara and went their way.
They’d had their gossip for the day.
There’s hoosework waiting to be dyun

His lordship likes to lie in bed
He’s like a bear with a sore head.
If Aah distorb him early on
before the noonday buzzers gone.

His breakfast forst then doon the pub.
It hurts to see him suffer so

Aim is my aim,
need is my tomorrow,
want is my future,
All I need is where my future would stand,
future is my aim,
My aim would be my future.
Your journey starts here it starts now
Your future is in your hands and know one shows you how
To make it, unfold, and have it turn out what you want it to be
Not anybody, not me
Talk it a step at a time
Even if your plans are stopped on a dime
Be careful, and listen, learn from your mistakes
Because one day you'll advance on the choices you make
Your future is here, your future is now
But don't worry, you'll show yourself how
Near the shore of that eventful destiny,
hold us no resentments of the past.
From the mistakes of the past, let us
not challenge the present and my friend,
I know I hurt you and even you hurt me.
For the time on which we heal the past
and erase our eroded egos
and I promise I cause you
no further harm, from my anger
on which I reacted but not intentional.
Calm now the seashore and I know
it is not easy to forget the clouds
of shadows covered on one
good friendship and at the end
wisdom is not a flagship label
to  cover the pretences of life
And i feel it is time to forget and forgive
in grace as life is too short to settle
scores on a battlefield to dampen
the creative brightness of  future..
November 30,2008
A memory or two
Returning...reappearing
Surprisingly entering our hearts again
Not the same...always rearranged
Haunting and intriguing
Living and dying
Pushing and pulling
Remembering togetherness
Moments of shared hearts
In the midst of isolation
Remembering that we were
Not alone
No longer applying
Such long forgotten
Traces of feeling and thought
Never again will our lives
Be as they were
A future uncertain...
With unknown duration
Past reflected as if present
Selecting each moment
Wondering...searching for meaning
Past changing...as the future
Takes hold of us
in the future moments will
come when one person says
to another, “That was great! ”
we never know what
the future holds in store
for us-in it’s infinite
wisdom-but surely you and I
know of it’s impending arrival
some believe the future
holds great times ahead,
some believe in a bleak
fate and still others believe
unborn moments hold
a catastrophic end
me, I like to think that
maybe, just maybe, it
will all happen at the same
instance-I mean some things
will be great, some bleak,
some beginnings and some endings
“great” things will only
happen in the future, because
of now, and that’s tough enough
to decipher-so I will plead, now,
and leave the future to the future
I never really imagined me
The me in the future, who I'd and where
People ask me, but all i do is stop and stare
Staring through them, it's like i cannot see
I never thought of myself in the future
Because all i ever wanted was to die
And then now people ask me, so i start to try
But i still can't see me....why?
I want to be with her
In the times yet to come
But if I'll be there I'm not really sure
It makes me feel so dumb
Maybe i won't be around then
Maybe I'll be long since gone
But when i ask myself, when
When might i leave, and forget all I've ever been
Today we face the trying times
Of heartache and pain.
Many hopes and dreams are shattered,
And prayers seem to be in vain.
With the hope of peace diminishing,
The heart has no definitive song.
We've waited for an end to hostilities,
But the struggle seems so long.
Yet - there is hope for the future,
Liberty and freedom are still in command,
But God will make the ultimate decisions.
He will evaluate our worldly demands,
And he holds the future in his grasp.
Why should we despair?
He mourns and counts every tear,
And he hears and reviews every prayer.
From the outset I must state
Old men (especially these!)  and (some)  women
Are not in me to hate
And thunderstorm I pray them not to strike
Because that is where I am headed
You all know and can certainly see
The truth, so by Amadiora may I not be beheaded
Most if not at all all offices around
Have sleepy octogenarians sleeping on the job
Waking up to remind me that my turn will come round
In the future, not near, not far- somewhere there
I am future leader you see
And so was my father before me
Who in that moment of despondency
Took to chang’aa- the local gin
Searching for hope in there- such futility!
Trying to discover the future in him
Unfortunately, he died of the liver disease
When he was about to be the future leader
Sort of!
All the while the increasingly old man and woman
Through press release s and conferences
Promised him and me as well
That we were leaders of tomorrow
What tomorrow I will ask not for now I know
Perhaps I should be like that Obama boy
Seizing the moment to bring the needed change
This is a letter from me to you
To let you know that truly I do
But the words I say cannot be used freely
So this letter is telling you that I do really
I do vow to do the dishes when ever you are sick
and I do vow to get medicine from the pharmacy quick
I do vow to keep you in your wonderful dream house
and I do vow if that can't happen you'll never see a mouse
I do vow to give you all the kids you need
and I vow if you don't want to I'll take the lead
I do vow to give you the best anniversaries you ever wished
and I do vow if we leave your parents will be missed
I do vow that I will love for all of my life
So I say I do to you being my lawfully wedded wife

PLEASE COMMENT!
In me, past, present, future meet
To hold long chiding conference.
My lusts usurp the present tense
And strangle Reason in his seat.
My loves leap through the future’s fence
To dance with dream-enfranchised feet.
In me the cave-man clasps the seer,
And garlanded Apollo goes
Chanting to Abraham’s deaf ear.
In me the tiger sniffs the rose.
Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble,
Since there your elements assemble.
The World energy resources depleted and the oil wells are running dry
And perhaps in a decade from now the super rich will become poorer when they realize their money cannot buy
Gas to put into their big cars parked in their garages the people with nowhere to go
To yet it is a known fact out of hardship that spirituality can grow.
We are being told that this is to happen by those one might say in the know
The oil reserves won't last forever we heard of that decades ago
Yet what did we do to conserve energy we went out and bought bigger cars
And spent billions in money and wasted huge amounts of energy building rockets for research on Mars
What will happen when the oil wells will run dry when the super rich will realize
That Government Bureaucracies them were deceiving and leading them on with their lies
Will billionaires jump off of big buildings when with financial disaster they come face to face
In a decade from now the World as we know it could be a much different place.
In the future the World will be different and that may not be such a bad thing
For Nature will live on as usual and songbirds in the morning will sing
And we must go back to the pushbikes and with less pollution in the air
We will be far healthier people and more spiritually and environmentally aware.
I remember when
love was a stranger
in a lonely life I led,
then you came along,
and my world changed
for the better.
You put sunshine into my smile,
air under my shoes,
made me feel ten foot tall,
and filled with love this empty shell.
Now love walks with me,
everywhere that I go.
The lonely life I lead is no more.
You are my soul and inspiration
as into the future we go.
During the war, I was in China.
Every night we blew the world to hell.
The sky was purple and yellow
like his favorite shirt.
I was in India once
on the Ganges in a tourist boat.
There were soldiers,
some women with parasols.
A dead body floated  by
going in the opposite direction.
My son likes this story
and requests it each year at Thanksgiving.
When he was twelve,
there was an accident.
He almost went blind.
For three weeks he lay in the hospital,
his eyes bandaged.
He did not like visitors,
but if they came
he'd silently hold their hand as they talked.
Small attentions
are all he requires.
Tell him you never saw anyone
so adept
at parallel parking.
Still, your life will not be easy.
Just look in the drawer where he keeps his socks.
Nothing matches.  And what's the turtle shell
doing there, or the map of the moon,
or the surgeon's plastic model of a take-apart heart?
You must understand --
he doesn't see the world clearly.
Once he screamed, "The woods are on fire!"
when it was only a blue cloud of insects
lifting from the trees.
But he's a good boy.
He likes to kiss
and be kissed.
I remember mornings
he would wake me, stroking my whiskers
and kissing my hand.
He'll tell you -- and it's true --
he prefers the green of your eyes
to all the green life
of heaven and earth.
Anonymous submission.
The soul it seeks to perch and pray
A tune that renders fine
Without a stop when started forth
It hopes to sing a line
With feathers wafting at its crest
Like hornets in its nest
In storm and lightning thunderous sounds
Appeal to all in zest
The warmth that beats within the chest
Is hard concealed to spin
But in the cold and on the seas
Its surely bound to win
Look to the future
Detach from the past
Let the people go
Start a new this time
Look to the future
Love like it’ll last
Dream like it’s forever
No move envy
Look to the future
Have the star life
Learn from others
Take it in
Look to the future
Be proud with yourself
No more lies
No more disguises
Look to the future
Solve the unresolved
Be someone’s firefly
Stop living for yourself
Look to the future
Be the person
You dream to be
Stop fantasizing
Look to the future
It’s only gets brighter
From here on out
Detach from the past
Look to the future
Dreams weren’t farfetched for me
Life wasn’t bad for me
I got everything I wanted,
Power and ability, and even opportunity
But I ignored something unknown.
I got an opportunity,
But I did not complete my wish.
I did not misuse my opportunity,
But this world has a sequence.
A flow which we all follow
Something I failed to do.
I used my powers at the wrong time.
I stepped into higher steps ignoring the lower ones.
But I failed to realize something,
I failed to realize that everything required a basement.
A basement on which it can stand.
A power on which it can function.
I ignored the lower aspects of my life,
I went for the larger ones and accomplished them with ease
But there were two things in the lower steps.
Two things that I ignored.
Time and patience.
I ignored the aspect of time, and looked into the future.
I lacked patience and was eager to reach the future.
But I failed to realize that the future did not exist.
We can never reach our future.
For, when we reach it, it becomes the present.
I failed to realize that the future is yet another present,
A present which I always ignored.
I failed to realize that we can control only our present.
Use the present wisely, and the future will follow up.
I failed to see the hidden mask of future.
A mask, if opened, showed that the future is just another present.
Not solely that the Future she destroys,
And the fair life which in the distance lies
For all men, beckoning out from dim rich skies:
Nor that the passing hour's supporting joys
Have lost the keen-edged flavour, which begat
Distinction in old times, and still should breed
Sweet Memory, and Hope,--earth's modest seed,
And heaven's high-prompting: not that the world is flat
Since that soft-luring creature I embraced,
Among the children of Illusion went:
Methinks with all this loss I were content,
If the mad Past, on which my foot is based,
Were firm, or might be blotted: but the whole
Of life is mixed: the mocking Past will stay:
And if I drink oblivion of a day,
So shorten I the stature of my soul.
I sit me down to think and write,
How to lead my Future Life,
Knowing it’s set by HIM alone,
But I don’t want to remain at Home.
For forty years I’ve toiled at work,
Difficult tasks I’ve not shirked,
But at Sixty Two I’ve more years to learn,
And from difficulties, I will not squirm.
But what will I do?
What will I learn?
Will I be happy?
For answers I yearn.
I wish to change my Life,
Be Happy and Well,
Have Peace of Mind,
Before the Final Bell.
I’m ‘Set in my Ways’,
I acknowledge that fact,
But change my Life I must,
With Discretion and Tact.

Before me stands I see,
a faceless form of the future.
I see an engraved darkness of her face,
so that I shall not know,
who this faceless person will be,
or our meeting how.
An before me I see the beauty of all creation,
so that I shall know not to yield to temptation.
For every mortal there is a weakness,
and within this weakness, temptation has its strength.
For me after my future love I’ve seen,
temptation seems heartless and mean.
Even though I guard against,
I am helpless in a sense.
For like a flower straight and tall,
must bend with the wind.
Therefore, I must lean a little when temptation calls.
(Date unknown, early 1970’s I think)
me and you
against the world.
that's the way it's always been
you keep my sane,
you keep me happy,
you keep my head above the water,
always telling me to keep my chin up.
the moment i heard stevie wonder i knew,
it was you and me forever.
'cos i luv you,
i just like the things you do,
dont you change the things you do'
the violins play,
i smile.
music means so much,
memories play like a home movie,
frozen stills of happy times,
of smiles and jokes, of tears and heartache,
of you and me. together.
my cynicism has evaporated,
my heart is full of happiness,
i hate to sound cheesy
but i want to spend my life with you,
i want to grow old with you,
i want to be happy with you,
you are my past present and future.
i want to wake up with you every monring,
not just every sunday,
i want your smile to be the first thing i see
and the last.
My future is already set
My future is finding the right person for me
I plan on keeping that one forever
This future tells me that i am going to have a perfect husband
My future tells me that i would be doing what i love in life
This future tells me to keep my dreams and opition open
In my future i am going to be a great mother
This future tells me already that i am going to have the man i always wanted and a babygirl named Dymond the name i always wanted too.
My future id just perfect....
My future
My future sounds like it so far away
but it gets closer to me each and every day
Im not sure on what I truly want to be
Everyone around is just confusing me
I promise my family and friends;
I will pursue a career.
But im always getting distracted by my peers.
The things that say seem to always get to me.
But in the future they will eventually see.
They'll see that my hardwork will pay off
They'll be begging my for help on my paid days off
Im smart but at times I refrain to use my brain
If I dont decide to now; Ill go insane.
As Im writing Im thinking about my future life
Whether someday the man of my dreams will call me his wife
So I'd better make up my mind
And prepare for my future! .
today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow i still just weep
next week, my spiral still goes down
feeling like a big clown
not knowing where i'll end up...
i panic, trying to save money but,
losing it to too many bills
next month, will i be over the hill?
or living in my car?
or working at the Nevada bar?
it scares me to think about it
i dont like my life one bit
wishing i'd be hit by a truck
but i dont have such good luck
today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow is still just weep
next week my sprial still goes down.
Next month...it scares me not to know.

"Let's make him a sailor," said Father,
"And he will adventure the sea."
"A soldier," said Mother, "is rather
What I would prefer him to be."
"A lawyer," said Father, "would please me,
For then he could draw up my will."
"A doctor," said Mother, "would ease me;
Maybe he could give me a pill."
Said Father: "Lt's make him a curate,
A Bishop in gaiters to be."
Said Mother: "I couldn't endure it
To have Willie preaching to me."
Said Father: ""Let him be a poet;
So often he's gathering wool."
Said Mother with temper: "Oh stow it!
You know it, a poet's a fool."
Said Farther: "Your son is a duffer,
A stupid and mischievous elf."
Said Mother, who's rather a huffer:
"That's right - he takes after yourself."
Controlling parental emotion
They turned to me, seeking a cue,
And sudden conceived the bright notion
To ask what I wanted to do.
Said I: "my ambition is modest:
A clown in a circus I'd be,
And turn somersaults in the sawdust
With audience laughing at me."
. . . Poor parents! they're dead and decaying,
But I am a clown as you see;
And though in no circus I'm playing,
How people are laughing at me!
You are my sole hope in all my life.
The last dejection has gone away
When I met you on that very day.
All the troubles are completely gone;
From now on, I am no more alone.
You are my sole hope in all my life,
My all reason to live – my future wife.
Living and hoping to still keep you
By my heart and soul – and it's for true,
My all reason to live, my future wife.
I'd love to live by your side to death,
And take away, for you, my last breath.
I can be everything when you are near,
And leave behind any issues; my dear.
You are my sole hope in all my life,
You've really made me the man I am,
And got me head over heels out of jam
– My all reason to live, my future wife.
You are my sole hope in all my life,
My all reason to live – my future wife.
im a little confused right now so in other words im not really sure
if i can slow down or even stop my past becoming my future
i can  see it comin a mile away
what can i do? what can i say?
who even cares seriously cause in all reality im not even sure that i do..
i try and try to do the right thing
but it just feels like stress and more stress is all it brings
now i want you to realize that this is not written and this one is off he top of my head
maybe im havin a bad day and i need to vent
or maybe its somethin someone said...
im good though i feel better already...
and thats the magic of poetry...
Our Future
Lies within the roots
Of the seeds
We have planted.
MY future will not copy fair my past
On any leaf but Heaven's. Be fully done,
Supernal Will ! I would not fain be one
Who, satisfying thirst and breaking fast
Upon the fulness of the heart, at last
Saith no grace after meat. My wine hath run
Indeed out of my cup, and there is none
To gather up the bread of my repast
Scattered and trampled ! Yet I find some good
In earth's green herbs, and streams that bubble up
Clear from the darkling ground, -- content until
I sit with angels before better food.
Dear Christ ! when thy new vintage fills my cup,
This hand shall shake no more, nor that wine spill.
The new hath come and now the old retires:
And so the past becomes a mountain-cell,
Where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell
In consecrated calm, forgotten yet
Of the keen heart that hastens to forget
Old longings in fulfilling new desires.
And now the Soul stands in a vague, intense
Expectancy and anguish of suspense,
On the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees
Like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown,
His timid future shrinking there alone,
Beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries.
Sitting in my garden chair
Surrounded with little flowers
Breeze tenderly touching
And lending a new feel
Brooding over the past
Thinking about wins and failures
About the people walked out
About the things not done
Getting away with present
No time to stop and think
Just doing, doing and doing
Just what is necessary today!
Hoping for the future
Dreaming of new horizons
About that special someone
And how life will change
My past is full of trouble
My present is filled with wisdom
My future is very uncertain
Which way do i go
Who should i listen to
My past has answers
My present seek questions
My future uncertain
Who am i
Who are they
What do you want
My past
My Present
My future
My life
Yet i don't know my future
But i hope i thrive on what i have learned
And what i have learned is what will make me surrive
Life
