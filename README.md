# LSTM BASED POETRY GENERATION USING NLP BY TELEGRAM BOT
In this project we worked on Natural Language Generation (NLG) by
building an LSTM-based poetry generator.

Long Short-Term Memory is an advanced version of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture that was designed to model chronological
sequences and their long-range dependencies more precisely than
conventional RNNs.

The dataset is a compilation of poetries written by numerous poets
present in the form of a text file.
